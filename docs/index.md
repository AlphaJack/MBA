# Welcome to MBA @ UniPD

Exam questions from my Master of Business Administration at the University of Padova.

## Motivation

At the beginning of my Master's program, I realized that I could retain more information by **testing my knowledge** with questions and exercises, rather than reading over and over the same chapters.

Since many professors did not provide proper training material for their exams, I asked some of my classmates to join me in creating a comprehensive **question bank**.

The result is a collection of exercises, open-ended and multiple-choice questions that helped us to get through our Master's with the **highest GPA**, while saving a lot of time to enjoy our student lifes.

It is now time to share this project with anyone interested in practicing more for their UniPD exams.

## Special thanks

I want to thank my **classmates** for joining me in this project, and **former students** for providing us with tips and exam questions.

A special thank goes to those **professors** that did their job with passion, inspired us to give our best, and prepared us to succeed.
