# Student associations

Padova is full of student associations, join them to make friends and memories for life:

- [Erasmus Student Network](https://padova.esn.it/): Organize small and big events for incoming international students, and get to know people from all over the world!
- [Goliardia](https://museodellagoliardia.it/): Rediscover ancient traditions, enjoy your youth in the most unconventional ways, but don't take yourself too seriously!
- ...and many more!
