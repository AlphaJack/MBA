# How to move

A brief but effective list of means of transport to reach your destination, including city buses and rental services.  

If you decide to purchase a bike, also buy strong locks because unfortunately bike theft is commonplace.

## Buses

Some advices:

- Tickets can be bought from tobacco shops or on directly on some buses, but with an extra charge
- Ticket inspectors are uncommon on small intra-city fares, but they give hefty fines to offenders
- Remember to raise your hand or bus drivers may not stop!
- The Busitalia Veneto app is useful to get a list of buses and times you can take to get from a location to another

## Sharing economy

There are many companies offering shared vehicles for rent.  
They also offer subscriptions, but here I will list only single use tariffs.  
Check out for eventual [university conventions](https://www.sostenibile.unipd.it/in-evidenza/mobilita-sostenibile-tre-nuove-convenzioni-per-la-comunita-universitaria/) for these partners.
