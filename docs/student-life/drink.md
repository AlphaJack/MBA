# Where to drink

Still work in progress!

## Beer

- [Crack](https://g.page/crakcasana): probably one of the best local craft breweries

## Spritz

- [Fly](https://g.page/flybarpizzeria): one of the few bars left that offer spritz at 2â‚¬
- [Caffe Carlotta](https://goo.gl/maps/7TvmgiuaZacyeTN47): other than chips, they offer you pizza on a wooden cutting board (for free!) if you take a spritz

## Wine

- [Corte Sconta](https://g.page/cortescontapadova): great wine choice, but you'll probably have to drink outside

## Cocktails

- [BarCode](https://g.page/barcodepadova): a wide choice of cocktails and shots for every taste


## Unique places

- [Bar da Mario](https://g.page/bar-da-mario): ask Mario and her daughter for a "Morandini" or a "Polifonico" (secret recipes!), and dive fully into the goliardic spirit
- [Naviglio](https://goo.gl/maps/5USjmXV7bNGVCSim7): opened from April to October, from 16 till late, experience a riverside walk full of bars
- [CafÃ© LumiÃ¨re](https://goo.gl/maps/iVBnpHp1uPKRqPK76): enter a peculiar BDSM atmosphere... ðŸ‘€
