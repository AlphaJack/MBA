# Welcome to MBA @ UniPD

Exam questions from my Master of Business Administration at the University of Padova

## Motivation

At the beginning of my Master's program, I realized that I could retain more information by testing my knowledge rather than reading over and over the same chapters.

Since many professors did not provide proper training material for their exams, I asked some of my classmates to join me in creating a comprehensive question bank.

The result is a collection of open-ended, multiple-choice questions and exercises that helped us get through our Master's with the highest GPA.
