Discuss the point using, if possible, your case study example.</p> Answer <p>Using market multiples is very relevant in the valuation process of a firm. The reason is that DCF models, even if they are very flexible and accurate methods based on a deep strategic and financial aniysis, are very much subject to subjective assumptions (like the growth of revenues, the dynamic of Trade working capital, CAPEX and many other items). </p> <p>So it is better to complement DCF methods with the results of the market multiples analysis, in order to increase the reliability, the accuracy and the plausibility of the results. The analysis of market multiples id based on the processing of the information of the market regarding the relationship between the value of a firm (based on the market value) and their underlying economic performance. Analysts should carefully select a list of CLC (comparable listed companies), calculate the value of these companies and analyze their performance. Afterwards, they should calculate their market multiples and analyze them in relation with their economic performance, in order to understand if there is a strong or weak relation between them.  </p> <p>The best multiples to use are EV/EBITA, EV/NOPLAT, because they focus solely on the company's operating performance. EV/EBITDA used to be another reliable multiple, but however with the new IFRS 16 its reliability has decreased. Other possible multiples are EV/Sales (generally unreliable, but sometimes reliable for companies with negative profit or in unstable industries), P/E (very distorted, because it mix operating performance, capital structure and non-operating items), EV/EBIT (not so reliable, because it includes amortization of intangible assets). In addition, there may exist also operating multiples specific of determined industries (e.g. related to the barrels of oil or to the seats in planes).  </p> <p>In our case study (Safilo), thanks to a general analysis of market multiples we were able to understand that the company was not performing as well as its peers in term of multiples. The implementation of this analysis was difficult, because the underlying performance of Safilo was particularly negative. Moreover, the truly comparable companies are not listed.  </p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is ROIC and what is its formula?</p> Answer <p>Return on invested capital is the amount of money a company makes that is above the average cost it pays for its debt and equity capital. Comparing a company's return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reveals whether invested capital is being used effectively. If ROIC is greater than the WACC the company creates value. ROIC is calculated through the following formula:</p> \\[ \\begin{split} \\text{ROIC} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{NOPAT}}{\\text{Invested Capital}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Net income} - \\text{Dividends}}{\\text{Debt} + \\text{Equity}} \\end{split} \\] <p>Question</p> <p>What does \"ROIC without goodwill\" represent and how is it calculated?</p> Answer <p>ROIC without goodwill measures the company's ability to create value over and above premiums paid for acquisitions. Goodwill is part of the financial capital, so excluding it from the formula, we can see if the company is able to generate value based only on its operating capital. It is calculated through the following formula:</p> \\[ \\text{ROIC}_{\\text{No GW}} = \\frac{\\text{NOPAT}}{\\text{Invested Capital} - \\text{Goodwill}} \\]"}, {"location": "courses/acf/exam/#cost-of-capital", "title": "Cost of capital", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>What is WACC and how is it calculated?</p> Answer <p>The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents a firm's average cost of capital from all sources, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and other forms of debt. It is calculated through the following formula:</p> \\[ \\text{WACC} = k_{d}\\frac{\\text{D}}{\\text{EV}}(1-t) + k_{e}\\frac{\\text{E}}{\\text{EV}} \\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>D/EV is target level of debt to value using market-based values</li> <li>E/EV is target level of equity to value using market-based values</li> <li>Kd is the cost of debt</li> <li>Ke is the cost of equity</li> <li>t is the company marginal income tax rate</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the relationship between \\(\\beta_{e}\\) (equity beta) and \\(\\beta_{u}\\) (unlevered beta)?</p> Answer <p>Beta represents a stock's incremental risk to a diversified investor, where risk is defined as the extent to which the stock moves up and down in conjunction with the aggregate stock market.  </p> <p>Equity beta is the variation according to its sensitivity due to market changes (equity + debt), while unlevered beta is the risk due solely to company assets, without taking into account the debt.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How can you explain why the discount rate applied by VC investor is much higher than the cost of capital estimated trough a market model (as the CAPM)?</p> Answer <p>It depends on the stage of financing: an early-stage investment is riskier relative to a late-stage investment and will thus require a much higher discount rate. Another explanation can be that if the VC fund expects the terminal value to be lower than the projected one, by increasing the discount rate it takes into account this expectation (without arguing with the entrepreneur about the \"real\" terminal value).  A higher discount rate simply adjusts the estimation about the terminal value.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/acf/exam/#multiples", "title": "Multiples", "text": "<p>Exercise</p> <p>Complete the following exercise about value driver multiples.</p> Data Entry Value Sales 5000 EBITDA margin 15% EBITDA Depreciation 150 Depreciation/EBITDA EBITA Tax rate 30% Taxes NOPAT Invested capital 3000 RONIC g 2% WACC 8% EV/NOPAT EV/EBITA EV/EBITDA EV/Sales Solution <p>The objective is calculating the four multiples at the end.

Companies in the same industry and with similar performance should trade at the same multiple. </p> <p>Using net enterprise value to EBITA (or NOPAT) rather than a P/E eliminates the distorting effect of different capital structures, non-operating assets, and nonoperating income statement items, such as the non-operating portion of pension expense.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Indicate the main ratios for judging the firm's financial health.  </p> Answer <p>The main financial indicators are:</p> <ul> <li>NFP/EBITDA: a debt ratio that shows how many years it would take for a company to pay back its debt if the net debt and EBITDA are held constant</li> <li>NFP/Equity: this indicator values in percentage terms the relative weight of the company's net financial position with respect to the equity book value</li> <li>Debt/EBITDA: a ratio measuring the amount of income generated and available to pay down debt before covering interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses.

Is there some relationship with \"financial engineering\" and \"operational engineering\"?</p> Answer <p>In governance engineering, PE investors control the boards of their portfolio companies and are more actively involved in governance than public company directors and public shareholders. Governance engineering involves creating a better alignment of incentives between managers and shareholders or providing better oversight that can limit empire building and opportunistic behavior. All of these three are value-increasing actions. These value-increasing actions are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but certain firms likely emphasize some of them more than others.</p> <p>Differences between FE, GE and OE: In financial engineering, PE investors provide strong equity incentives to the management teams of their portfolio companies. At the same time, leverage puts pressure on managers not to waste money. In governance engineering, PE investors control the boards of their portfolio companies and are more actively involved in governance than public company directors and public shareholders. In operational engineering, PE firms develop industry and operating expertise that they bring to bear to add value to their portfolio companies.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Describe the main protections for an investor in a venture capital transaction</p> Answer <p>The main protections for a VC investor are hareholders' agreements, vesting of founder's shares and preferred stocks:</p> <p>Shareholders' agreements are the most basic way VCs protect their investments. VCs are concerned about changes in control, including:</p> <ul> <li>veto power or supermajority voting rules</li> <li>right of first offer</li> <li>right of first refusal</li> <li>tag-along right</li> <li>drag-along right</li> </ul> <p>Vesting of founder's shares means suspending the common stock rights which are then gradually released over a period of time (step vesting) or at one time (cliff vesting). Vesting prevents the entrepreneur from leaving before a certain time. Vesting is sometimes also used for founder's shares owned before the first VC investment.</p> <p>Preferred stocks (PS) have a liquidation preference over common stock: that is, in the event of sale or liquidation of the company, PS gets paid prior than common stock. Generally the face value of PS is the cost basis the VC fund pays for the stock. Convertible Preferred Stocks (CPS) can be converted at the shareholders option into common stock. Redeemable Preferred Stock (RPS) is preferred stock with no convertibility into equity. It can be combined with common stock or CPS. Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (PCPS) combines a position in RPS plus common stock.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What do we mean by \u201cfinancial engineering\u201d in a LBO transaction and what are the relationships with the other PE value levers?</p> Answer <p>In a LBO transaction, financial engineering is a branch of finance that is in charge of valuating the target company. The vast majority of the PE investors rely on gross IRR (25%) and Multiple on Invested Capital. Over 70% also incorporate comparable company multiples. In contrast, relatively few PE investors use DCF methods. The valuation may be calculated through:</p> <ul> <li>a five-year forecast horizon, at the end of which they typically calculate a terminal or exit value    </li> <li>an exit or terminal value obtained from an EV/EBITDA multiple.

For example, the best private equity firms don't just recapitalize companies with debt; instead, they improve the companies' performance through improved governance.

Explain why.</p> Answer <p>Convertible bonds are typically issued by companies that have high expectations for growth and less-than-standard credit ratings. The companies get access to money for expansion at a lower cost than they would have to pay for conventional bonds. Investors, in turn, get the flexibility of turning their convertible bonds into cash or stock shares. A startup company with little current revenue and rapid growth potential might be an ideal candidate for issuing a convertible bond.</p> <p>For example, in 2014, Tesla Motors issued $2 billion in convertible bonds to finance the construction of the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada. Tesla had reported low or negative earnings over the few years leading up to 2014. Raising capital for the project using standard bonds would have been prohibitively expensive as investors would have demanded steep interest rates in return.With the conversion option, the interest rates on Tesla's convertible bonds ranged from 0.25% to 1.25%.

A price range is then suggested to investors. Based on the roadshow presentation, investors are asked to provide non-binding indications of interest (bids). One of the key features of the open price approach is that allocation of shares among institutional investors is decided by the investment bank on a discretionary basis. There is very little underwriting risk.</p> <p>Fixed price was the standard practice in Europe, but it has been in decline for many years, especially for larger offerings. The key feature of the fixed price approach is that the issuer and its investment bank set the price before bids are submitted. In other words, the price is fixed with information about the market demand. There are two kinds of fixed-priced offerings: </p> <ul> <li>firm commitment (or underwritten) </li> <li>best effort (non-underwritten)</li> </ul> <p>In the first case (the most common one) the investment bank underwrites the offer, thus guaranteeing the full proceeds to the issuer, regardless of the actual demand. In the second case, the bank just puts its best effort to sell the shares, with no underwriting.</p> <p>Historically, auction is the least common price-setting mechanism. It was frequently used only in France. In an auction investors are invited to bid for shares, and once the offering is covered, shares are allocated at a single clearing price. As for book-building, the price is set after bids are submitted. The crucial difference between the two techniques, is that in book-building the price and allocation rules are not transparent (because they are discretionary): the bank does not have to allocate to highest bidders and may also ignore them at all.</p> <p>Currently the most used price-setting mechanism is book-building, at least for institutional tranches.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Illustrate the main benefits and costs of going public</p> Answer <p>The main benefits of going public are:</p> <ul> <li>it helps entrepreneurs to sell their company for a value higher than what they would get from a trade sale</li> <li>because of the dual-track process, it can help to solicitate bids from private bidders within a time frame established by the IPO process</li> <li>it helps the company to pursue a strategy of external growth</li> <li>it improves the public image of the company</li> <li>it allows for management compensation benefits; stock options and other similar performance-based compensation provide the right incentive to the management</li> </ul> <p>The main costs are:</p> <ul> <li>it disclosures requirements and compliance costs</li> <li>it surrounds the company by authorities, analysts, institutional investors screening the firm activities</li> <li>it introduces corporate governance issues, that may be problematic</li> <li>it involves direct costs such as fees paid to lawyers, consultants and investment banks for the IPO process, not to count periodic balance sheet audits</li> <li>it involves indirect costs such as underpricing; the amount of money that the issuer loses are the number of share issued, times the first day capital gain</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>Explain the pros and cons for issuing a convertible bond in a growing firm which actually generates negative earnings and free cash flows (as Peloton in the interactive fitness business). </p> Answer <p>A convertible bond is a particular type of hybrid securities. Hybrid securities are financial instruments that have both elements of Debt and Equity. A convertible bond is a corporate bond that can be exchanged for common equity at a pretedermined conversion rate. So, the Convertible bond can be seen as the sum of a straight-debt compontent and an equity component (call option on equity). </p> <p>Usually firms set the conversion rate in a way that the conversion price is higher than the current stock price. Convertible bonds are very interesting instruments for growing firms, which may actually generate even negative earnings or FCF. Convertible bonds are useful in cases of asymmetric information and in cases where there is a gap in the risk perception between the issuer and the investors. Since the two components of the convertible bond react differently to an increase in risk, convertible bonds may be very powerful instruments to brige the perception gap between issuer and investors. Moreover, convertible bonds attract a certain category of investors (so issuing them may broaden the investors base), and are treated differently (for the better) by the rating agencies. Finally, convertible bonds can be seen as \"Cheap debt\u201d, because usually they are issued at better terms for the issuer, with respect to normal debt. Morover, they can be also seen as \"delayed equity\".  </p> <p>So Convertibles are very interesting instruments for growing companies with negative FCF and profits, for the reasons said above. However, if convertible bonds are exercised, they will dilute the equity and the control position of the existing shareholders (and their rights on the earnings).</p>"}, {"location": "courses/acf/exam/#mergers-and-acquisitions", "title": "Mergers and acquisitions", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>In an M&amp;A transaction how can you estimate the maximum offering price for the target firm? </p> Answer <p>In an M&amp;A transaction, the maximum offering price for the target can be estimated starting from the Target Stand Alone value. Then we add the value of the synergies (the value of the possible performance improvements deriving from cost, capital and revenues improvements), and we deduct the value of the intrinsic risk of the deal (so here we can include the possible dis-synergies that may derive from the deal). Afterwards, we can add to this result the value of the so-called \"strategic premiums\", which are the sum of the strategic option and the competitors' actions prevention value. The former can be intended as a \"window for opportunities\u201d in the future, that may arise if the acquirer company realizes the deal. The latter (competitors' actions prevention value) is the value we assign to the loss that we would incur in if the competitors performed this deal. So the strategic premiums are more immaterial premiums, but they still have a value.

If so, what are the reasons? </p> Answer <p>In a distressed firm usually the market value of the debt of a firm is lower than its nominal value, because in these firms the risk of default is higher.  In fact, when valuing the debt of a distressed firm, analysts and investors have to be careful, because the value of the debt may be related to the value of the firm (instead for investmentgrade debt, the value of the debt is independent with respect to the value of the firm). Usually, this kind of debt trades at a discount with respect to its face value. The amount of the discount depends on the default probability of the company on its debt. In particular cases of severely distressed companies, debt may even have to be valued with a scenario analysis or with an option pricing method.  </p> <p>The market value of debt is lower because companies with higher default probability have higher credit/default spreads. Default spread is higher because the gap between the promised FCF and the expected FCF of the debt increases, risk of default increases. Moreover, also the credit rating of a company plays a very important role. The credit rating of a company is an opinion on the probability of default of a company and its debt. For investment grade companies, the default probability and the credit spread increase as the rating decrease, in a proportionate trend. However, for non-investment grade companies, the default spread increases in a more-than-proportional way, with respect to the default probability. This is due to the fact that the market for non-investment grade debt is smaller, and because investors in this market usually put a lot of effort in screening the companies, and thus they are remunerated through higher credit spreads.  In distressed firms the debt trades at a discount because the firm is not able to meet its financial obligations and service its debt payments (interests, principal). There are different levels of financial distress, which may be related with different discounts on the nominal value of the debt. A financial crisis may be related to a prior economic crisis, which can derive from poor operating performance, strategic problems, lack of efficiency in operations. When a firm is in a financial distress, there are two options: Restructuring (the claimants bargain on the going concern of the firm)(Ch. 11 if in-court) or Liquidation (the assets or the going concern of the firm are sold, and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors according to the Absolute priority rule)(Ch. 7 if in-court). If the going concern value of the firm is lower than the face value of its debt, but higher than the liquidation value, a restructuring plan is better]lf the going concern value is lower than the liquidation value of the firm, a liquidation procedure is necessary.  </p> <p>Question</p> <p>How can you manage the excess debt in the restructuring process of a distressed firm?</p> Answer <p>If there is excess debt in a restructuring process, there are three general actions firms can take, in agreeement with the creditors: the extension of the debt, the exchange of the debt for shares, the write-off of the debt. For example, the extension of the debt is de-facto achieved with Ch. 11 with the \"Automatic Stay\" provision. Another important provision of Ch.11 procedure is the \"debtor-in-possession\u201d, which allows the firm to raise new debt (so, new cash) in order to implement the restructuring plan, which will be senior with respect to the existing debt.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>In a financial distress situation, what are the main benefits and costs of a bankruptcy procedure vs a workout?</p> Answer <p>Benefits in bankruptcy:</p> <ul> <li>simplified voting rules which might be crucial to a successful resolution of the distress</li> </ul> <p>Costs in bankruptcy:</p> <ul> <li>more expensive than workout mainly because of time</li> <li>longer than private workouts because of judges and dealing with all the creditors and must approve most of decisions</li> <li>higher direct costs (advisory and legal fees) and indirect costs (asset going-concern value reduction): any cost will depend on the length of time it takes to resolve distress</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>Describe content and role of the debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing. How can you calculate the fair market value of this type of debt?</p> Answer <p>In DIP financing the firm can issue new senior debt to outstanding debt. The firm can thus get fresh money. DIP financing represents a major source of funding to bankrupt companies and is often lined up in advance so it can be accessed the moment a company files. Because a DIP loan enters the firm's capital structure as a senior claim, ranking alongside or ahead of its prepetition debts, DIP financing offers a solution to the \"debt overhang\" problem. DIP financing also reduces any potential adverse impact of asymmetric information on the cost or availability of new financing to distressed companies. Companies that obtain DIP financing are more likely to reorganize successfully and to reorganize in less time than firms that do not obtain such financing. DIP financing has been historically the exclusive preserve of commercial banks.</p> <p>The debt is calculated as follows:</p> \\[ D = \\sum_{t=0}^{n}\\frac{\\text{CFD}_{t}}{(1+\\text{YTM})^{t}}+\\frac{\\text{FV}}{(1+\\text{YTM})^{n}} \\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>YTM is the sum of the risk free rate (\\(r_{f}\\)) and the risk premium of that specific bond</li> <li>FV is the face value</li> <li>CFD is the coupon value</li> </ul> <p>The risk premium in the YTM is the multiplication between the probability of default and the loss incurred when the issuer defaults. The coupon value is obtained from the cost of debt \\(k_{d}\\), that can be calculated in two ways:</p> \\[ \\begin{split} k_{d\\ \\text{CAPM}} &amp;= r_{f} + \\text{MRP} \\times \\beta_{d} \\\\ k_{d\\ \\text{spread}} &amp;= r_{f} + \\text{spread} \\\\ \\end{split} \\] <p>Question</p> <p>Explain the difference between the \"pari passu\" and the \"waterflow\u201d approach in a debt restructuring proposal</p> Answer <p>In the \"pari possu\" approach equity-holders receive at the exit an amount of proceeds based on the initial stake (e.g. 50%, 30%, 20%). In the \"watelflow\u201d approach equity-holders receive of the exit an amount of proceeds based on a specific non-proportional structure.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Describe the operating and financial sides of distress illustrating a framework for dealing with distress.</p> Answer <p>From the operating side, when a firm is forced to sell a subsidiary or a given asset to a third party there is a divesture. Ths can obviously lead to a reduction of operations due to the loss of the asset or the entire production plant. From the financial side, a distressed firm for sure has a higher interest rate if it wants more debt, but worse financial ratios (Debt/EBITDA, EBIT/Interest expenses, Debt/EV).</p> <p>According to the studied framework, an irreversible distress crisis happens when the going-concern value (the value that the company is able to generate when it continues operating) is lower than the liquidation value of that company. Until that point, the crisis is reversible, especially when the going-concern value is higher than the face value of debt (potential crisis).</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Illustrate (better if in bullet form) a typical corporate restructuring road map.</p> Answer <p>In a corporate restructuring, firm claimants such as creditors, managers and shareholders bargain about the future of the firm, either in court or out of it. Debt is repaid based on a restructuring plan of the company that maintains its going concern. It is made of the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Conduct financial analysis (IS, BS and FCF analysis)</li> <li>Prepare for restructuring (stakeholder communication plan, creditor disagreement approach)</li> <li>Decide the restructuring approach (debt-equity swap, transfer of assets, exchange for equity)</li> <li>Implement debt restructuring (employee layoff, structure changes)</li> <li>measure the impact (decrease in debt, increase in cashflow, financial statements improvements)</li> </ol> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the typical firm\u2019s restructuring process?</p> Answer <p>The restructuring process is either managed trough:</p> <ul> <li>out-of-court workout, if management and shareholders recognize the crisi status early and decide to intervene promptly</li> <li>in-court reorganization (bankruptcy), if out-of-court workout is not feasible</li> </ul> <p>The process is made of the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Crisis identification: report on short-term liquidity, short-term debt, covenants fullfil, debt sustainability and equity health</li> <li>Restructuring plan: moratorium request, new business plans, indipendent business review, financial proposal arrangements</li> <li>Plan negotiation: consensus creation on the restructuring agreement among shareholders and creditors with different seniority</li> <li>Plan implementation: board approval, agreement formalization, start of either the in-court or out-of-court</li> </ol> <p>Question</p> <p>Explain briefly in what consist the hold-out problem.</p> Answer <p>In the hold-out problem, claimants are unable to find an agreement and they might not approve the restructuring plan, even when this will produce a sub-optimal outcome. Factors that influence the likelihood of approval of the restructuring plan are:  </p> <ul> <li>number and sophistications of claimants</li> <li>public debt outstanding, as every bondholder has to agree to the term changes</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "courses/afa/exam/", "title": "Advanced Financial Accounting exam questions", "text": "<p>This is a comprehensive list of exam questions and exercises with step by step solutions and answers, obtained from official exams and exams simulations.

Once there, some data evaporates in the Data Warehouse after certain time. The DL also allows for data mining through AI to obtain either supervised learning (predefined categories, e.g. X and Y when doing a regression or data classification) and unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering)</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the two main approaches/school of thought to build a BI system?</p> Answer <p>Bill Inmon (top-down approach): start by conceptually designing the DWH from the DS (requires to predict the actual and future needs of the company), and from this design the DM accordingly. This approach is best suited for large and stable companies.</p> <p>Ralph Kimball (bottom-up approach): start by designing the DM (stars and snowflakes) according to the business needs, and from this design the DWH. This approach is the best for new or dynamic companies.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the two most used Data Mart configurations?</p> Answer <p>Multidimentional OLAP (MOLAP) stores the data in supercubes, while Relational OLAP (ROLAP) does it in relational, star or snowflake form.</p> <p>With MOLAP, each axis intersection is precalculated. It is fast but only if it handles a small amount of data. Companies create their EPM assumptions using MOLAP and since it allows them to test hyphotesis and scenarios. MOLAP is more oriented in scenario comparison at an aggregated level (it would be too costly to compute every row combination).</p> <p>With ROLAP, there are links between tables, and the model is adapt when there is a big amount of data to manage. For this reason the earliest adopters were financial, retailers and telecomunication companies. However, adding assumptions and whatif scenarios to ROLAP is not easy, and this remains the main drawback of this format. ROLAP is more oriented in descriptive analytics.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the first two steps in the EPM process?</p> Answer <p>The first step is performed annually, and consists in defining and building the annual plan. It takes as input the last month of the last period, and generates an output for the first month of the next period.</p> <p>The second step is performed monthly and consists in measuring the gap between forecasted and actual plans. These gaps will be then analyzed and reforecasted in following steps.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the three main features of Big Data?</p> Answer <p>The main features of Big Data are:</p> <ul> <li>Volume: in terms of occupied storage, often require a distributed filesystem</li> <li>Velocity: collection and updates may happen in real-time</li> <li>Variety: data could be coming from internal or external sources, and be structured or unstructured</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>How does a Data Lake differ from a Data Warehouse?</p> Answer <p>In a DWH, stored data is structured and arranged vertically according to dimensions, hierarnchies and levels. The DWH consist of relational databases that can host terabytes of data.</p> <p>In a DL, stored data is often unstructured and stored horizontally. The DL consists of a distributed filesystem and a noSQL database that can host exabytes of data.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are two predictive models of supervised machine learning?</p> Answer <p>Supervised ML can be obtained by  predefining categories, such as the ones to use in classification or the variables of a regression analysis (linear, logistic, ARIMA...)</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Give 2 business examples of jobs in companies where Business Intelligence is bringing a real added value when it is used on mobile devices (such as smartphones or tablets).</p> Answer <ul> <li>Field worker: they need to rely on the real-time information, accessible by their smartphone</li> <li>Manager: they check their smartphone for quicker view of a report or a dashboard</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>Give 2 business examples where Business Intelligence is using some methods and tools from Artificial Intelligence (like machine learning for predictive or prescriptive analytics).</p> Answer <ul> <li>In online marketing, machine learning detects the patterns of a user to show them better (targeted) advertising</li> <li>Banks detecting fraud due to some out-of-order/suspicious activities and alerting the client</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>You are the chairman of a multinational company and you want to improve the Business Intelligence maturity level of your enterprise. You want to transform your organization from a very siloed approach where some BI heroes are located in different departments of the company, to a more transverse and consolidated approach where you can decrease the costs and increase the efficiency of Business Intelligence projects. What will be your proposal for:  </p> <ul> <li>the target BI organization of your company and associated sponsor/head of this new BI organization  </li> <li>the required skills in this new BI organization</li> </ul> Answer <p>Enterprise at a higher level of maturity should have integrated process. To allow a more transverse and consolidated view of the company a dedicated team should work between departments in a Business Intelligence Competency Center (BICC). It allows to decrease the costs as there is no duplicated work and less external consulting, and to increase the efficiency as they can provide the managers with the right information. The associated sponsor should be a chief data officer</p> <p>For a BICC to work efficiently the team should have 3 different types of knowledges:</p> <ul> <li>Business (understand business as a whole)</li> <li>IT (support operational system)</li> <li>Analytical (statistical skills)</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>You want to build a decision support system for your company, using the scrum agile method. This system will provide 3 key performance indicators (Return on Investment for Finance, Net Promoter Score for Marketing, and On-Time Delivery for Supply Chain). The system requires 3 data layers: first an Operational Data Store to collect the data from various sources, then a Data Warehouse to store the data, and finally some Data Marts to present key performance indicators to the managers through dashboards. You have 3 sprints to deliver the whole system. What will be the MVP of each sprint and why?</p> Answer <p>Since the three KPIs are more independent than the three components of the BI system, by delivering a single KPI, one third of the business would be satisfied. By dividing the sprints in KPIs, in the first sprint I would allocate the minimum amount of resources needed to fully deliver the first KPI (so the BI system should work at least for it). During the second sprint I would add the data and infrastructure needed to deliver the second KPI, and the same would apply for the third sprint.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the main advantages and disadvantages of querying directly on source systems?</p> Answer <p>Advantages:</p> <ul> <li>architecture simplification (easier to manage and maintain)</li> <li>cost reduction (no intermediate interfaces to create)</li> <li>time saving (no intermediate interfaces to send)</li> </ul> <p>Disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>sources are strongly coupled to BI (difficult to manage and maintain)</li> <li>warning on source modifications (synchronization and coordination)</li> <li>warning on performance impact (source systems may slow down)</li> </ul> <p>The direct coupling between upstream operational/transactional source systems and the downstream Business Intelligence system should thus be used with parsimony. In most cases it is preferred to use intermediate interfaces to avoid coupling.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the main data transformations available during an integration process?</p> Answer <p>Active data transformations (number of records is changing):</p> <ul> <li>filters</li> <li>routers</li> <li>joins</li> <li>aggregations</li> <li>ranks</li> </ul> <p>Passive data transformations (number of records is not changing):</p> <ul> <li>operations on characters and strings</li> <li>operations on dates and types</li> <li>operations on numerical data (calculations)</li> <li>lookups (searches)</li> <li>sorts (ordering)</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>Our school wants to monitor what is said on social media (mainly Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin) regarding the e-reputation of the different programs, and would like to identify, catch and analyze what are the MOOCs and online streaming video courses that the students are watching on the web, in addition of the courses provided at school.  </p> <p>What do you need to add to your BI system to take in account this new type of analysis, and why?  </p> Answer <p>We need to add a Data Lake to deel with volume, variety and velocity of this new kind of data.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/bi/exam/#exercises", "title": "Exercises", "text": "<p>Exercise</p> <p>What is the result of a full join between these 2 datasets?</p> Client ID Client name City ID 001 Bernard 1 002 Martin 2 003 Robert 004 Richard 3 005 Simon 1 City ID City name 1 Paris 2 Lyon 3 Marseille 4 Lille Solution <p>A full (outer) join results in all the rows to appear in the final table, regardless if they have empty columns:</p> Client ID Client name City ID City name 001 Bernard 1 Paris 002 Martin 2 Lyon 003 Robert 004 Richard 3 Marseille 005 Simon 1 Paris 4 Lille <p>Exercise</p> <p>ESC Clermont Business School wants to improve its Business Intelligence maturity level through the implementation of a new decision support system, in order to become one of the most data-driven organization in the world.    </p> <p>First, the top management would like to analyze the number of students, whatever their status (prospects, enrolled students or alumni) that the school has per program (Bachelor, Master in Management, Master of Science, etc) over time (per semester and per year), as well as their minimum, maximum and average age, minimum, maximum and average tuition fees, per city, country and continent in the world (Europe, America, Africa, Asia, etc).  </p> <p>Moreover, the top management would also like to assess the performance of each academic program, per module and per type of professors (full time, associate or affiliate), knowing that a module can belong to only one program, but can be taught by one or several professors, and knowing that each professor can teach one or several modules, but is belonging to only one department of the school (FEDS, HOM or I&amp;D).  </p> <p>Every semester and every year, for each module, professor and department, all the programs will be evaluated through the number of hours, the minimum, maximum and average student grades (scores given by the professors), as well as the minimum, maximum and average student ratings (assessement provided by the students).  </p> <p>Create the 2 different OLAP snowflake data models used in the Data Marts of the future BI system.</p> Solution <pre><code>classDiagram\n Students -- City\n Students -- Program\n Students -- Semester\n Students -- Status\n City -- Country\n Country -- Continent\n Semester -- Year\n\n class Students{\n  idCity\n  idProgram\n  idSemester\n  idStatus\n  ageAvg\n  ageMax\n  ageMin\n  tuitionAvg\n  tuitionMax\n  tuitionMin\n }\n\n class City{\n }\n\n class Country{\n }\n\n class Continent{\n }\n\n class Program{\n }\n\n class Status{\n }\n\n class Semester{\n }\n\n class Year{\n }</code></pre> <pre><code>classDiagram\n Program -- Module\n Program -- Semester\n Module -- Professor\n Professor -- ProfessorType\n Professor -- Department\n Semester -- Year\n\n class Program{\n  idModule\n  idSemester\n  hours\n  gradeAvg\n  gradeMax\n  gradeMin\n  ratingAvg\n  ratingMax\n  ratingMin\n }\n\n class Department{\n }\n\n class Module{\n }\n\n class Professor{\n }\n\n class ProfessorType{\n }\n\n class Semester{\n }\n\n class Year{\n }</code></pre> <p>Exercise</p> <p>In order to put a Business Intelligence system in place for the next intake in October 2021, the IT department of the school has decided to use an agile method, knowing that some requirements are still very fuzzy. You know that you have only 10 months before the intake, each month having 20 working days. The overall backlog of the project has been evaluated around 1500 story points. Each iteration (sprint) of the project will last 4 weeks (meaning 20 working days). The first and last days of each sprint will be of course dedicated to agile ceremonies.   Each member of the agile project team will be able to deliver 2 story points per day, whatever the sprint. We assume that each of them will be missing 3 working days per sprint, because they are not dedicated to the project.  </p> <p>How many people are required in the agile project team to deliver the full backlog in 10 months?  </p> Solution <p>The team must deliver 1500p/10s = 150 points per sprint. The effective working days in a sprint for each member are 20d/s - 2d/s (ceremonies) \u2013 3d/s (missing days) = 15 days per sprint. Each person can deliver 2p/d * 15d/s = 30 points per sprint. The minimum number of people required to deliver the project in time is 150p/s / 30p/s = 5.  </p> <p>What will be the velocity of this agile project team (number of story points delivered by sprint)?  </p> Solution <p>The team can deliver 30p/s * 5 = 150 points per sprint.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/gtsm/exam/", "title": "Game Theory and Strategic Management exam questions", "text": ""}, {"location": "courses/gtsm/exam/#simultaneous-games", "title": "Simultaneous games", "text": ""}, {"location": "courses/gtsm/exam/#pure-strategies", "title": "Pure strategies", "text": "<p>In this kind of games each player knows the possible payoffs, so they can suppose what the other player will choose in order to mazimize its payoff.   </p> <p>To find the Nash equilibria in pure strategies, one has to:</p> <ol> <li>find eventual dominant strategies for each player and choose them</li> <li>if no dominant strategy has been found, proceed finding the best response for each player</li> </ol> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Find all the Nash equilibria in pure strategies of the following simultaneous move game in normal form.</p> L R A 6,4 3,9 B 5,7 2,4 Solution <p>Strategy A is dominant for P1, as whatever the choice of the opponent is, he is always better with the payoffs offered by A than the ones he would get by choosing B.

Therefore neither player has a profitable deviation. There are no equilibria where P1 plays F, since then it would be optimal for P2 to play X, but then P1 would have a profitable devaition to E.</p> <p>Finally, we think about the whole game. We know that if P1 plays A, they reach subgame 1, in which case they get 1. If they play B, they reach subgame 2, where they get 4.

Different jurisdictions have different laws about contracts, so they look at the same thing but with their own perspective.</p> <p>Effects:</p> <ul> <li>Binding force of a contract: among its parties it has the same binding force provided by law if the contract if properly formed and signed. If one of the parties breaches one of the terms it's as. It is breaching the law.</li> <li>Privity of contract principle: does not allow obligations for third parties if they are not involved directly in the contract.</li> </ul> <p>Structural elements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parties: they are two or more, both natural person (human being) or non-natural person (legal person \u00e0 fictious entity) can enter a contract. Some jurisdictions also provide for unilateral contracts (as an example donation in Italy). Parties must have the legal capacity to enter the contract. For legal capacity we intend to have the legal age (18+ in Italy) and not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The principle of freedom of contract says that parties must be free to enter the contract and parties are also free to determine the object of the contract. It's against the law and the contract is invalid if:</p> <ul> <li>One party make relevant and reasonably mistake</li> <li>One party is under influence of a threat</li> <li>One party wants to fraud the other</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Meeting of minds: when the offer matches the acceptance. It's considered matched when all terms and conditions are agreed by all parties.     If the contract is signed, but parties are far from each other, it is required to find the jurisdiction of the contract:</p> <ul> <li>Letterbox rule (like in UK): when the person who receives the offer mail the acceptance the contract is started (more trust among parties and more efficiency of postal services)</li> <li>Actual acceptance's receipt (like in Italy): the person that places the offer needs to receive the acceptance in the business domicile the contract is started (less trust among parties and less efficiency of postal services)           </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Object: every contract must be characterized by an economic value even if one or more parties does not have an economic significance. The object must be explicitly determined in the contract, must be legal and has to be intended in two ways:</p> <ul> <li>Content, i.e the obligation among parties, for instance party A must deliver wood to party B and party B need to pay Party A for that</li> <li>Purpose, i.e the type of contract, for instance a purchase and sale agreement or a performance and service one</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Consideration: the reason why the parties sign the contract. For every contract there must be a bargained for exchange, which means that every part of the contract has some benefits from signing that contract but also some costs associated, the costs can be monetary or non-monetary (usually property title).     There must not be a \"gross disproportion\" between the benefits and the sacrifices for all the parties, especially for B2C contract because the law tent to protect consumers (paternalistic attitude). Example: in a purchase and sale agreement, the seller gives up the property title for money and the buyer pays some amount in exchange for the property right of the good.</p> </li> <li> <p>Formalities: how the terms are written. They can be:</p> <ul> <li>Written: here we can have addition formalities<ul> <li>Notarized for authenticate (for example for create a company)</li> <li>Registered with public authorities in public register for the existence to third parties</li> </ul> </li> <li>Oral: parties actually contract with each other, and they discuss term and condition about the contract but they don't want to write down those terms and conditions (under this setting is much more difficult prove things, because \"verba volant, scripta manent\")</li> <li>De facto: doctrine elaborate by judges find a partnership where a partnership was never entered into by the parties.

It implies that a party can ask for:</p> <ul> <li>Specific performance: asking the judge that the other party perform what that the contract provided for, sometimes this is not possible, for instance if a lawyer doesn't want to defend you there is no way to obligate him</li> <li>Damages: it covers all the expenses in order to get those expenses (layer fee), but also for the missing profit</li> <li>Both the above</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the main types of contracts?</p> Answer <ul> <li>Commutative or exchange contracts: one party undertakes to do or pays something in exchange for delivery of goods or perform a service</li> <li>Multilateral contracts: there are more than two parties, such as life insurance contract with an insurance company, many customers and third parties partners</li> <li>Associatory contracts: all the parties take the same position, as they share the same interet, such as shareholders in a company or associations</li> <li>Multi-party contracts: even if only party establish the company by a unilateral act, the contract is \"open\" to subsequent adhesions by an indefinite number of people that can be both human or legal persons</li> <li>Consumer contract: the legal system takes away some freedom of contract because all the terms and condition are settled up by the company because consumer are viewed as weaker party of the relationship</li> <li>Commercial or business contract: there is more freedom of contract than in a consumer contract because it's assumed that the bargaining power of the two businesses are more or less the same, given on the company size. EU wrote down regulations to protect SME from large corporations as if it was a consumer contract</li> <li>Discrete contract: relation exists between the parties apart from the simple exchange of goods</li> <li>Long-term contract: effects are based on a relationship of trust between the parties</li> <li>Relational: cooperative contract with usually involving some degree of asset specificity and often exposed to ex-ante and/or ex-post opportunism</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What does the Williamson matrix suggest?</p> Answer <p>The Williamson matrix can aid deciding if it is better to pursue a long term contract or buying from the market directly:</p> <ul> <li>Market governance: buy from the market</li> <li>Trilateral governance: \"third party assistance\" is used for resolving disputes or evaluating performance</li> <li>Bilateral governance (relational contracting): long term relational contract between two independent firms, does not import any unification/merge between the two independent firms</li> <li>Unified governance: companies who produce, there are more incentives from a cost point of view to merging together.

The most common features are:</p> <ul> <li>Guarantees, collateral, enforced if the other part don't respect  the clauses of the contracts</li> <li>\"Dealing in good faith\" terms, general clauses used to curb the opportunism of other party</li> <li>Renegotiation clauses, used to explicitely set the conditions for new negotiations</li> <li>Hardship clauses a way to terminate the contract if something happens, unless the other part agrees to a renegotiation</li> </ul> <p>It is required to match the governance with the appropriate type of contract in order to lower transaction costs as possible.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Explain the concept of Smart contracts</p> Answer <p>Smart contracts can be defined as computer programs that regulates and automates the relationship between two or more parties. Features of smart contracts:</p> <ul> <li>Self-enforcement: parties negotiate conditions but after that it's very difficult to renegotiate</li> <li>Designed to cooperate with digital and real world contracts</li> <li>Need data to work</li> <li>Use token such as digital vouchers</li> <li>Democratic because they are immutable and incorruptible</li> <li>No need for intermediaries, for instance when collecting data to calculate insurance premiums</li> <li>Can expose one part to privacy issues if one part can monitor the other</li> </ul> <p>Under common law jurisdictions like the US, judges tailored solutions for every aspect of different cases as they require more flexibility.</p> <p>Example of smart contracts employment:</p> <ul> <li>Sharing economy<ul> <li>B&amp;B</li> <li>Shared office space o Car sharing</li> </ul> </li> <li>Small amount of transaction contracts</li> <li>Easy contracts (not M&amp;A)</li> <li>Insurances<ul> <li>Medical</li> <li>Automotive</li> </ul> </li> <li>Regularly contracts<ul> <li>Supply of goods</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "courses/ibcl/exam/#companies", "title": "Companies", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>What are the five common characteristics of a company?</p> Answer <p>Companies have \"common\" characteristics because there is a convergency trend among all jurisdictions, as these are always present in the corporate law of every country and are useful for investors in order to start a relation with the management.

It often delegates its power to officers. Directors are subjected to fiduciary duties. The evolution of firms tents to this setting of division of powers based on the professionalism of managers.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the return on the investment in a company?</p> Answer <p>With investors' ownership every investor who invests in a company has the right to dividends. Also, under the golden rule the power is proportionally distributed among investors.

However, the corporation has no obligation to reacquire the shares, so the investor has to find a buyer on the market where its stocks are traded.</p> <p>Companies can be:</p> <ul> <li>Public held: traded in the public market</li> <li>Private/close: need to be sold through private agreement</li> <li>Limited liability company: there are quotas and not shares, those type of firm can never go public</li> <li>Partnership</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What are investors' responsibilities to others?</p> Answer <p>If the investors of a corporation are given limited liability, only the corporation is liable for its own obligations. Shareholders cannot be asked to repay the debt of the company, so they only risk their investment. On the other hand, directors and officers are not liable for corporate obligations if they acted respecting their fiduciary duties .  </p> <p>In small businesses such as private companies or limited liability companies it's possible that in order to obtain financial resources shareholders may be asked by potential creditors to use personal assets as collateral guarantees for reducing insolvency losses or granting a lower interest rate.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>When does the investment in a company begin and end?</p> Answer <p>When a corporation is formed, it has an independent perpetual existence. It is distinct from:</p> <ul> <li>Who gives the capital initially (shareholders) \u00e0 they come and go, but business remain</li> <li>Who manage the business (directors and officers)</li> </ul> <p>Legal personality tells the investors if and when the company close, but also the transferability of the shares can be intended as an ending of the investment.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/ibcl/exam/#agency-theory", "title": "Agency Theory", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Why are managers risk-averse?</p> Answer <p>As business organizations grow, managers tend to become risk-averse, as they would like to protect their position maximizing their chance of success by selecting easy tasks; this however does no longer result in the maximization of the shareholders' interests.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Explain the concept of Bounded Rationality,</p> Answer <p>Contracts by nature are incomplete in the sense that they can't forecast all contingencies arising from the relationship between parties.</p> <p>Bounded rationality is one of the characteristics that make contracts incomplete.

Committees are frequent, which are groups of members that deal with a specific matter and with some responsibility. The composition of the board of directors needs to include both, executive and independent directors. External members support to provide an objective approach and to monitor executives</li> <li>Two-tier system: there are three mandatory organs such as general shareholder meeting, supervisory board, non-executives and management board and executives. The difference between the one-tier is that the two-tier has a slow decision process but the outcome of the decisions are less contestable</li> <li>Latin model: the general shareholders meeting has to appoint both, the management board and the internal audit committee, also called the board of statutory auditors. The management board has to manage the business. The internal audit committee has to monitor the managers' activities, it stays normally for three years and it elects the external auditor. It is composed primarily of non-executive directors and at least one needs to have a financial/accounting background. The external independent auditors are normally selected by the board of statutory auditors and formally appointed by the general shareholders meeting</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the main differences between indipendent and non-executive directors?</p> Answer <p>Directors can be classified according to their role and their relationships with the company.</p> <p>Role:</p> <ul> <li>Executive: employee of the company (example: CEO, CFO, COO, etc.). They are not necessary but, usually, they are sitting on the board of directors</li> <li>Non-executive: if they are not involved in the day-to-day management and they do not have a specific power to represent the company vis-\u00e0-vis third parties. If a director is non-executive not necessarily is also independent</li> </ul> <p>Relationships:</p> <ul> <li>Independent: they cannot be executives and they supervise the executive in the board of directors. They need to have an autonomous judge. They do not maintain, directly or indirectly or on behalf of third parties, nor have recently maintained any business relationships with the issuer or persons linked to the issuer, of such a significance as to influence their autonomous judgement</li> <li>Non-independent: they have some degree of conflict of interests with the company, for instance they are spouses or contractors</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "courses/ibcl/exam/#investors-ownership", "title": "Investors Ownership", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Explain the concept of Investor Ownership.</p> Answer <p>Any unspecified use of a resource (capital, labor) belongs to the owner to that resource. Owning a right on a resource means that one can control that resource.</p> <p>Examples: if one invest some equity in a business project, the use of that equity is for the person that has invested in that project. Any return of the invested equity not dedicated to somebody else belongs to the investor; if a person buys machineries can do whatever he wants with it, if he rents it, he is limited by the contract's condition or mandatory rules by the law, because he doesn't have the residual claim.</p> <p>The power of shareholders, also known as investors' ownership, consist of:</p> <ul> <li>Electing and remove directors</li> <li>Approving fundamental corporate changes (mergers, acquisitions, conversions, divisions, dissolutions)   </li> </ul> <p>All of these rights can be executed:</p> <ul> <li>Directly, in partnership, partners are entitled to manage the company</li> <li>Indirectly, in public held company shareholders are not entitled to manage the company</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the relationship between shareholders? How can they vote?</p> Answer <p>According to Jensen and Meckling, when shareholders are scattered out, all of them own a small fraction of the entire enterprise value. They have the same objectives and goals, but their economic incentives are so low that they don't want to put effort in monitoring the agent (in this case the management of the firm) and for them is difficult to find a coherent decision to give to managers.</p> <p>So managers are free to do what they want inside the contract signed with the shareholders due to the lack of monitoring.</p> <p>Shareholders can vote directly or indirectly, it depends if there is a separation between ownership and management. With direct voting they are also the managers and they can drive business decisions, if they are only shareholders they vote indirectly by appointing managers.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is a shareholders' agreement?</p> Answer <p>Under Italian law, companies can be incorporated by unilateral act or by agreement, but a public deed (atto pubblico) is required.</p> <p>The shareholders may - at the same time or later \u2013 conclude a shareholders' agreement (patto parasociale) that is outside the deed of incorporation and the bylaws, Art. 2341-bis Codice Civile.</p> <p>Such an agreement is just optional; it is not required for the formation of a company.</p> <p>Examples: appointment of representatives to the boards, the restrictions on share transfers, the exercise of voting rights, the pre-emption rights on share transfers, the minority shareholders\u2018 protection.</p> <p>Companies, depending on their status (public, private or resorting to capital market) will follow different sets of rules regarding this topic:</p> <ul> <li>Listed public companies: application of Art. 122 ss. Legislative Decree 58/1998 (consolidated law on finance).</li> <li>Closely held public companies: application of Art. 2341-bis Codice Civile (introduced by company law reform 2003).</li> <li>Public companies that resort to capital markets: application of Art. 2341-ter Codice Civile (introduced by company law reform 2003).</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>Explain the concept of Cumulative Voting System.</p> Answer <p>The cumulative is a voting system thought for minority shareholders: multiple lists are presented and list owners (majority or minority) decide how to allocate votes on its candidates.</p> <p>In Italy, list voting system is very similar to cumulative voting system:</p> <ul> <li>Each shareholders entitled to vote at the ordinary shareholders' meeting, shall have the right to submit a list</li> <li>Each list must not contain more than the number of directors up for election</li> <li>Any shareholder entitled to vote may vote only a single list</li> <li>Each shareholders can cast a number of votes proportionally to the number of shares held </li> </ul> <p>Unlike cumulative voting, in list voting, the total number of votes obtained by each list is then divided by the progressive number assigned to each candidate.

Nimble dividends is a dividend paid out of a corporation's current earnings when there is a deficit in the account from which dividends may be paid. Nimble dividends are permitted in some states, while not in others.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Explain the concept of Par Value and Accountable Par</p> Answer <p>A par value for a stock is its per-share value assigned by the company that issues it and is often set at a very low amount such as one cent.</p> <p>since companies were required by state law to set a par value on their stock, they choose the smallest possible value, often one cent. This penny price is because the par value of a share of stock constitutes a binding two-way contract between the company and the shareholder.</p> <p>If shareholders pay less than the par value for a share of stock and the issuing company later becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, its creditors can sue shareholders for the difference between the purchase price and the par value to recoup the unpaid debt. If the market price of the stock falls below the par value, the company may be liable to shareholders for the difference. </p> <p>There is a choice of two basic types of no par value share: the \"true\" version permitted in the US and Canada and the \"accountable par\" model, permitted in Belgium and Luxembourg.</p> <p>The \"true\" no par value share according to the American model has no par value and no share capital. The solution for voting rights, profit-sharing and the liquidation quota for the remaining assets is reduced to \"one share-one vote\" and the profit-sharing and the liquidation quota correspond to the number of shares. Under this model, the share capital is not reflected in the balance sheet. By implication, there is no direct correlate between shares and capital - as a result, both quantities can be changed independently of one another.</p> <p>In the case of the \"accountable par\" value share, the share capital remain a balance sheet item, but the par values of the individual shares are repealed. By consequence, an arithmetical or \"fictive\" par value can still be assigned to the share by determining the amount of the individual share with respect to the entire share capital.        </p> <p>Unlike a stock, a bond has a real par value. The bond is worth its par value at maturity.</p> <p>Eexample, if company XYZ issues 1,000 shares of stock with a par value of $50, then the minimum amount of equity that should be generated by the sale of those shares is $50,000. Since the market value of the stock has virtually nothing to do with par value, investors may buy the stock on the open market for considerably less than $50. If all 1,000 shares are purchased below par, say for $30, the company will generate only $30,000 in equity. If the business goes under and cannot meet its financial obligations, shareholders could be held liable for the $20-per-share difference between par and the purchase price.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/ibcl/exam/#corporate-social-responsibility", "title": "Corporate Social Responsibility", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Explain the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility.</p> Answer <p>Corporate social responsibility is a self-regulating business model that helps a company be socially accountable to itself, its stakeholders, and the public.

The first two rules below are a consequence of the segregation of assets.</p> <ol> <li>Rule of priority: the personal creditors of shareholders have no recourse against the money of the company because of legal personality of the company completely separates from the shareholders. But, the creditors of the company have priority over the assets that have been segregated</li> <li>Liquidation protection rule: shareholders of a company can't just go away whenever they want, unless the company has been created for an unlimited duration. Each shareholder is entitled to a pro quota share of the company and that money is necessary in order to keep the business going (otherwise they jeopardize every business future plan). They can sell their shares if they want to quit the company (free transferability of shares) or ask the company to liquidate a quota of their net assets at the present value</li> <li>Attribution rule: the power of a person to act on behalf of the company.

The settlor can be the beneficiary (as a warranty) and also the trustee (as an example if we have a guy that has 30 years he could set up a trust to pay his children college, if so there is no need of constitution). But, creditors can attack the trust in order to obtain the credit.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the role of debtors in Trusts?</p> Answer <p>If you are the trustmaker, also known as the \"settlor\" or \"grantor\", it is essential to create an irrevocable trust if you want to protect the assets you place in the trust. Because revocable trusts can be terminated or modified at any time, your creditors will typically be able to reach the assets in an irrevocable trust since you normally, technically retain control over and benefit from them.</p> <p>However, with irrevocable trusts, you often give up control over its assets and receive no benefit. In essence, legal title is effectively, and permanently, transferred to a third-party, here the trustee. This means that, in many situations, creditors can't collect money from an irrevocable trust to cover your debts as the grantor.</p> <p>If you are the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust, judgment creditors will not typically be able to take money directly from the trust. However, they usually can access distributions you receive from the trust. When family trusts include a \"spendthrift clause,\" which limits the amount of income the trustee can distribute to a beneficiary, it can help protect assets from creditors as long as they remain in the trust, except in some limited circumstances in some states.</p> <p>As is often the case when it comes to the law, the answer to this question is \"it depends.\" If you have transferred your assets into a revocable trust, your creditors will typically be able to access those revocable trust assets to satisfy a judgment debt. However, if you have transferred your assets into an irrevocable trust or if you are the beneficiary of a trust, the answer can become a bit more convoluted.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/ibcl/exam/#effects", "title": "Effects", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Describe internal trust in Italy and the economic effects of trusts.</p> Answer <p>An internal trust can be viewed as all the parties and assets in the trust are based in Italy.

Centros argued that it had the right to be recognised in Denmark under the provisions of freedom of establishment in the EC Treaty.</p> <p>The CJEU held that the Danish authorities' refusal to recognise the company was contrary to articles 52, 56 and 58, and that its rules on minimum capital were not justified by the aim of protecting creditors by anticipating the risks of fraudulent bankruptcy due to the insolvency of companies having inadequate initial capitalisation.         National authorities can adopt less restrictive measures, such as enabling creditors to obtain necessary guarantees, or could adopt measures preventing or penalising fraud, if necessary with the cooperation of another Member State.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Discuss the Polbud vs. Poland case focusing on the Freedom of Establishment</p> Answer <p>In September 2011, the shareholders of Polbud, a LL company established under Polish law, decided to transfer the company's registered office from Poland to Luxembourg. This operation completed in May 2013, and subsequently, the new company \"Consoil Geotechnik\" lodged an application with the Polish registry court for its removal from the commercial register. This application was refused to be registered because, as the registry court stated, Polbud failed to provide evidence of the successful execution of a liquidation procedure. Polbud appealed against this decision, arguing that no liquidation was needed because the company continued to exist as a legal person incorporated under Luxembourgish law.</p> <p>The CJEU stated that:</p> <ul> <li>the freedom of establishment applies to the transfer of the registered office of a company from one Member State to another even if no real business is intended to be conducted in the latter Member State</li> <li>the transfer of a registered office from one Member State to another cannot presume a fraud or justify a measure that adversely affects the exercise of a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the Treaty</li> <li>the regulatory power of a Member State (Poland) ends when a company (Polbud) converts itself into a company (Consoil Geotechnik) governed by the law of

The production technology displays the following costs, where C(i,j) represents the cost of producing i units of X and j units of Y:</p> <ul> <li>C(0,50) = 100</li> <li> <p>C(0,100) = 210</p> </li> <li> <p>C(5,0) = 150</p> </li> <li> <p>C(10,0) = 320</p> </li> <li> <p>C(5,50) = 240</p> </li> <li>C(10,100) = 500</li> </ul> <p>Does this production technology display economies of scale? Of scope?</p> Answer <p>This technology does not display economies of scale. The cost per unit of making 50 units of Y is $2, and the cost of making 100 units of Y is $2.10. Since the cost per unit does not decrease as the quantity of Y increases, this technology does not display economies of scale in the production of Y. The result is analogous in looking at the costs of making X, as well as looking at the costs of making X and Y together in greater quantities.  </p> <p>This technology does display economies of scope in the production of X and Y. The cost of making 5 units of X is $150 and the cost of making 50 units of Y is $100. Made separately, the total cost of making 5 units of X and 50 units of Y is $250. The cost of making 5 units of X and 50 units of Y together is $240.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Economies of scale are usually associated with the spreading of fixed costs, such as when a manufacturer builds a factory. But the spreading of fixed costs is also important for economies of scale associated with marketing, R&amp;D, and purchasing. Explain.</p> Answer <p>Fixed costs are those costs that do not vary directly with output. Fixed costs must be expended in order to initiate production, but also for activities such as selling the output or developing improvements to the output. As the firms scale of operation increases in terms of volume of output and number of products produced, functions related to marketing, R&amp;D and purchasing are spread over more units\u2014hence reducing the cost of each of these activities per unit sold. For example, once a firm invests in developing a new product, those R&amp;D costs are fixed regardless of the scale of that product.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the main differences between economies of scales and learning economies?  </p> Answer <p>Economies of scale are said to exist if average costs decrease as output increases. Learning economies, a source of economies of scale, refer to a reduction in average costs due the accumulation of experience and know-how.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Suppose you wanted to quantify a firm's learning experience. One possible measure is the firm's lifetime cumulative output. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this measure? Can you offer a superior alternative     measure?</p> Answer <p>The magnitude of learning benefits is often expressed in terms of a slope. The slope for a given production process is calculated by examining how far average costs decline as cumulative production output doubles. It is important to use cumulative output rather than output during a given time period to distinguish between learning effects and other scale effects.  </p> <p>Question</p> <p>Why Do Firms Diversify? Discuss potential benefit(s) of diversification.</p> Answer <p>Diversification aims to reduce the company risks of demand fluctuation, offering a more linear income from customers. It can also exploit economies of scale and scope if different final goods can involve the same raw materials, machineries, or distribution channels employed for the goods a company is already producing, lowering the cost per unit. It can also allow to exploit internal capital markets, to allocate resources where needed if some products are not yet generating substantial revenues.</p> <p>Other benefits can include product bundling, when complementary products of the same brand are sold together at a lower price than the two alone. Diversifying requires an initial investment and sometimes may not be as desired by shareholders as it is by managers, but market mechanisms like leverage buy outs mitigate the risk of abuse.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of diversification? What can be done to prevent managers from abusing it?</p> Answer <p>Shareholders have a more diversified portfolio and are able to reduce their risks within the same company.</p> <p>Diversification involves an initial cost and a continuous cost for management control.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How does the firm-level elasticity of demand shape the opportunities for making profit in an industry?</p> Answer <p>TODO</p>"}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#the-vertical-boundaries-of-the-firm", "title": "The vertical boundaries of the firm", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>What is a reason that companies might want to \"buy\" instead of \"make\" talent from the market when looking to acquire employees with a particular skill set?</p> <ol> <li>External training methods are better than internal ones</li> <li>Companies are always willing to pay more for external employees</li> <li>External training is more advanced (up-to-date) than internal</li> <li>Scale economies can result in fixed education costs while in house education methods may be more expensive</li> <li>Externally trained employees are more likely to become better business leaders</li> </ol> Answer <p>4</p> <p>Question</p> <p>The reduction of coordination and holdup problems depends on:</p> <ol> <li>Governance arrangements</li> <li>Manager contracts</li> <li>Required quality of finished product</li> <li>Cost of upstream vertical supplies</li> <li>None of the above</li> </ol> Answer <p>1</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following is not a characteristic of a complete contract?</p> <ol> <li>The contract allows a party to exploit weaknesses in another party's position as the transaction unfolds</li> <li>Elimination of opportunistic behaviors</li> <li>Stipulation of each party's responsibilities and rights</li> <li>Binding instruction for each party on courses of action as the transaction unfolds</li> <li>Must be enforceable</li> </ol> Answer <p>1</p> <p>Question</p> <p>A manufacturer of pencils contemplates backward integration into production of rape seed oil, a key ingredient in manufacturing the rubber-like material (called factice) that forms the eraser. Rape seed oil is traded in world commodity markets and its price fluctuates as supply and demand conditions change.</p> <p>The argument has been made in favor of vertical integration: \"Pencil production is very utilization sensitive, i.e., a plant that operates at full capacity can produce pencils at a much lower cost per unit than a plant that operates at less than full capacity. Owning our own source of supply of rape seed oil insulates us from short-run supply-demand imbalances and therefore will give us a competitive advantage over rival producers.\"  </p> <p>Explain why this argument is wrong.  </p> Answer <p>Ensuring supply might be a valid argument for vertical integration if the market for rape seed oil were extremely illiquid and inefficient, but it is traded freely on world commodity exchanges. In this case, there are no economic benefits to vertical integration that cannot be achieved through market exchange \u2013 an arms-length transaction is simply internalized within the firm if transfer prices are set at the market level. However, if transfer prices are held constant, this will lead to inefficient use of rape seed oil. The firm will fail to use the optimal quantity of rape seed oil in downstream production and would subsidize its upstream division when market prices were low or support its downstream division when market prices were high.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>In each of the following situations, why are firms likely to benefit from vertical integration?</p> <ol> <li>A grain elevator is located at the terminus of a rail line</li> <li>A manufacturer of a product with a national brand name reputation uses distributors that arrange for advertising and promotional activities in local markets</li> <li>A biotech firm develops a new product that will be produced, tested, and distributed by an established pharmaceutical company</li> </ol> Answer <ol> <li> <p>A grain elevator owner would benefit from vertical integration for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Coordination Costs: The use of market firms often present coordination problems. This is problematic for inputs with design attributes that require a precise fit between different components. It may be that storage bins and railcars need to be so designed. Timing is another important factor with grain. The grain operator would want to ship the grain as soon as possible to avoid spoilage, etc. Since only one rail line operator is likely to exist, it will have few incentives to closely coordinate with the grain elevator owner. Having centralized administrative control as an integrated firm would solve these coordination problems.</li> <li>Transactions Costs: Arranging for timely pick-up and delivery through contracts could be extremely difficult and costly to enforce if the rail line operator lacks competition and can act opportunistically. Furthermore, the rail line operator can charge a higher fee for its services. (holdup problem)</li> <li>Processing Efficiencies: Locating assets side-by-side may allow the operators to economize on transportation or inventory costs or to take advantage of processing efficiencies. (This is a concept called site specificity, which is discussed in Chapter 3.)</li> <li>Economies of Scale: The grain operator may be able to achieve distribution economies of scale by having its own rail operation as opposed to contracting with individual transportation providers.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The manufacturer would benefit from vertical integration for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Coordination Costs: The manufacturer will be better able to coordinate national and local advertising and promotions, thus conveying a consistent message/brand image across local markets and maximizing the impact of advertising and promotions on sales. (Sequencing).</li> <li>The manufacturer can better coordinate the release of new products with local advertising and promotional activities. (Timing).</li> <li>A manufacturer's own distributors/sales force will be focused on selling only its products, whereas independent distributors have competing interests since they will also be selling products from rival manufacturers. May even be that the distributor's promotional activities violate the manufacturer's intended image of the product.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The biotech firm would benefit from vertical integration for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Coordination Costs: Given the level of importance of the design attributes (mix of component chemicals, performance specifications, etc.) for a new biotech product, the coordination of these activities is critical for the pharmaceutical company to avoid potentially costly mistakes.</li> <li>Leakage of Private Information: The biotech firm will likely have to divulge proprietary product information in order for the pharmaceutical company to manufacture the new product. As a result, the biotech firm risks giving up valuable product design information that could be used by the pharmaceutical company to develop a competing product.</li> <li>Transaction Costs: In order to prevent the pharmaceutical company from producing or distributing a competing product, the biotech firm would have to incur significant contracting costs. Enforcement, in particular, could be difficult given the complexity of the product.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Question</p> <p>Discuss the firm's arrangements that can help to avoid the risk of holdup.</p> Answer <p>Holdup problem can be avoided using self-enforceable contracts. In this way, for example, downstream firm's payment is automatic and cannot be just cancelled. We can think about smart contracts based on blockchain technology.  </p> <p>Another solution is the possibility of owning the assets and use the counterpart as an \"independent worker\". We can think about GM and Ford that own the machinery to produce some componer ut these components are produced by third party firms.  </p> <p>Another solution is to use relational contracts with long term agreements and renegotiation clauses or options.</p> <p>Another solution, that goes beyond the arrangements between firms, is complete vertical integration.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Universities tent to be highly integrated \u2013 all department tent too belong to the same organization. There is not a technical reason why a university could not consist of freestanding departments linked together by contracts, much in the same way that a network organization links freestanding businesses. Why do you suppose that universities are not organized in this way?</p> Answer <p>The underlying reasons behind the existence of integrated universities include:  </p> <ul> <li>Coordination Costs: There are several issues with regard to coordination, such as<ul> <li>timing: individual departments must coordinate around a common academic calendar</li> <li>sequencing: a common sequence of courses towards degree requirements needs to exist</li> </ul> </li> <li>Organizational Issues: The university departments are bound by ties of social similarity such that they value their association with each other in addition to any monetary issues involved in their departments. This commitment supplements the more formal governances inside the university making internal governance more effective than market governance. Culture can also complement formal governance mechanisms within the university making the internal organization more effective than the market could be. Contracting a common culture for a \"networked\" university promises to be virtually impossible.</li> <li>Economies of Scale: By remaining integrated, a university can take advantage of several economies of scale, including<ul> <li>purchasing economies of scale,</li> <li>marketing economies of scale in attracting both students and professors,</li> <li>the spreading of fixed investments such as real estate, information technology and sports-related investments, </li> <li>the spreading of administrative overhead.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>These activities could not be accomplished as efficiently through contracting.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Why does assymetric information lead to inefficient actions?</p> Answer <p>Why does assymetric information lead to inefficient actions?</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Some contracts, such as those between municipalities and highway construction firms, are extremely long with terms spelled out in minute detail. Others, such as between consulting firms and their clients, are short and fairly vague about the division of responsibilities. What factors might determine such differences in contract length and detail?</p> Answer <p>Factors that might determine differences in contract length and detail include verifiability and measurability of performance. In the case of the highway construction contract, it may be easier to specify the terms of performance than in the case of the consulting project. That is, it may be easier to specify design specifications, timing, acceptable road quality, etc. When performance under a contract is extremely complicated to specify, as one would expect in the case of the consulting contract, it may be difficult to elaborate each party's rights and responsibilities within a written contract. The language in such contracts is often left vague and open-ended because it is not clear what constitutes fulfillment of the contract.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>In many modern U.S. industries the following patterns seem to hold: What factors might explain these patterns?</p> Answer <ul> <li>Small firms are more likely to outsource production of inputs than are large firms;     Small firms are more likely to outsource the production of inputs because they are unable to reach the necessary scale efficiencies in-house. Vertical integration would leave them uncompetitive.</li> <li>Standard inputs (such as a simple transistor that can be used by several electronics manufacturers) are more likely to be outsourced than \"tailor-made\" inputs (such as a circuit board designed for a single manufacturer's specific needs).     Complex inputs are more likely to be made in-house than standard inputs because the specificity of these products and the assets required to produce them leads to the \u2018hold- up' problem. The upstream firm is at risk from the expropriation of the profits it makes from the production of the inputs, which are worth less in alternative uses. As a result the upstream firm will underinvest and fail to produce the inputs at the optimal level of quality and efficiency for the downstream firm, which may also be exposed to high costs if there is any supply disruption. Therefore it is often more efficient for the downstream firm to take control of the production of complex inputs themselves.</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>Why a firm using a capital-intensive production process is more likely to vertically integrate?  </p> Answer <p>Capital intensive firms often face high fixed costs that require an high minimum efficiency scale.</p> <p>By vertically integrating, it can spread fixed costs such as R&amp;D, machinery and advertisement over a large production quantity</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the main reasons to make and to buy?</p> Answer <p>The main reasons to make are:</p> <ul> <li>avoid coordination with third parties</li> <li>avoid the leak of private information</li> <li>avoid transaction costs and contractual issues</li> </ul> <p>The main reasons to buy are:</p> <ul> <li>lower prices from market firms thanks to their learning economies or internal economies of scale</li> <li>avoid agency costs and internal issues</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>How can double marginalisation affect the firm strategic decision to vertically integrate, i.e. to merger?</p> Answer <p>Double marginalisation happens when both upsteam and downstreams suppliers apply a markup to the price of the products they sell, the final price is higher than in the case where only a vertically integrated firm produces the good, as there is only a single markup.</p> <p>In this case by vertically integrating it is possible to offer a good at a lower price.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is an incomplete contract and what are its main features? Hint: also talk about possible mitigations for negative characteristics</p> Answer <p>Incomplete contracts are characterized by bounded rationality, coordination problems and opportunism.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#integration-and-its-alternatives", "title": "Integration and its alternatives", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Analysts often array strategic alliances and joint ventures on a continuum that begins with \"using the market\" and ends with \"full integration\". Do you agree that these fall along a natural continuum?</p> Answer <p>No. Alliances and joint ventures fall somewhere between arm's-length market transactions and full vertical integration. As in arm's length market transactions, the parties to the alliance remain independent business organizations. But a strategic alliance involves much more coordination, cooperation, and information sharing than an arm's length transaction. A joint venture is a particular type of strategic alliance in which two or more firms create, and jointly own, a new independent organization. The firms involved with a joint venture integrate a subset of their firms assets with the assets of one or more other firms.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What does the Keiretsu system have in common with traditional strategic alliances and joint ventures? What are some of the differences?</p> Answer <p>Keiretsu are closely related to subcontractor networks, but they involve a somewhat more formalized set of institutional linkages. Usually the key elements of the vertical chain are represented in a keiretsu. The firms in a keiretsu exchange equity shares, and place individuals on each other's boards of directors - U.S. firms are in many cases prohibited from these practices under the U.S. antitrust laws.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>The following is an excerpt from an actual strategic plan (company and product names have been changed to protect the innocent): Acme's primary raw material is PVC sheet that is produced by three major vendors within the United States. Acme, a small consumer products manufacturer, is consolidating down to a single vendor. Continued growth by this vendor assures Acme that it will be able to meet its needs in the future. Assume that Acme's chosen vendor will grow as forecast. Offer a scenario to Acme management that might convince them that they should rethink their decision to rely on a single vendor. What do you recommend that Acme do to minimize the risk(s) that you have identified? Are there any drawbacks with your recommendation?</p> Answer <p>Acme must have a valid reason for using a single supplier. A key merit of Acme's approach is asset specificity on the vendor's side, when the vendor might be encouraged to make specific investments. However, there is the potential of hold-up problems created by decreasing the number of vendors down from three to one. The likelihood of hold-up problems would depend on the degree of asset specificity and switching costs. The amount of implicit and explicit costs related to hold-up problems would depend on the level of inventory, customers' expectations and brand reputation. For example, if Acme can only produce its product with Company X's component and Company X ceases shipments, unless Acme has sufficient amount in inventory of the components, Acme will incur significant losses immediately due to lack of sales.  </p> <p>In order to minimize its risks, Acme could second source or backward integrate (partially or fully). Second sourcing or backward integration protects the firm from hold-up but may drive costs by reducing purchasing discounts, increasing production coordination and requiring additional investments by the second source. An alternative solution would be for Acme to consider tapered integration. Tapered integration poses the usual make-or-buy problems, such as high costs, coordination problems and poor incentives.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Describe the trade-off between technical efficiency and agency efficiency an organization can face</p> Answer <p>The costs and benefits of relying on the market can be classified as relating to either technical efficiency or agency efficiency.</p> <p>Technical efficiency indicates whether the firm is using the least-cost production process. A firm could achieve technical efficiency by purchasing the good in question from a market firm or by investing to develop the skills itself.</p> <p>Agency efficiency refers to the extent to which the exchange of goods and services in the vertical chain has been organized to minimize the coordination, agency, and transaction costs. A firm could achieve agency efficiency by improving its structure and agent monitoring.</p> <p>For example, when a computer maker obtains memory chips from themarket, the firm may improve its technical efficiency by buying from specialized chip manufacturers. But this arrangement may reduce agency efficiency by necessitating detailed contracts that specify performance and rewards. The appropriate vertical organization of production must balance technical and agency efficiencies.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How can an organization achieve the advantages of vertical integration wihout integrating? Provide some examples of countries where this is a consolidated practice.</p> Answer <p>A company can benefit long term contracts, as it happens in Japan with keiretsu and South Korea with chaebol.</p> <p>It can also mitigate variation in suppliers prices by purchasing futures in the commodity market.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#market-and-competitive-analysis", "title": "Market and competitive analysis", "text": ""}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#competitors-and-competition", "title": "Competitors and competition", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>What term describes the differentiation of a product when only some consumers prefer it to competing products (holding price equal)?</p> <ol> <li>Horizontal differentiation</li> <li>Vertical differentiation</li> <li>Idiosyncratic differentiation</li> <li>Spatial differentiation</li> <li>Non-price differentiation</li> </ol> Answer <p>1</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following firms maintains a monopoly or cartel by controlling essential inputs thus creating a barrier to entry?</p> <ol> <li>DeBeers in diamonds</li> <li>Nike in shoes</li> <li>Pepsi in beverages</li> <li>Subway in sandwich fast food</li> <li>Levis in denim jeans</li> </ol> Answer <p>1</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Why are the concepts of own and cross-price elasticities of demand essential to competitor identification and market definition?</p> Answer <p>The magnitude of consumer responses to changes in a product market\u2019s (or industry\u2019s) price is measured by the own-price elasticity of demand, which equals the percentage change in a product market\u2019s sales that results from a 1 percent change in price. If an industry raises price and consequently loses most of its customers to another industry (or industries), we conclude that the market under consideration faces close substitute products (or the product market competes with other product markets).  </p> <p>Measuring the own-price elasticity of demand tells us whether a product faces close substitutes, but it does not identify what those substitutes might be. We can identify substitutes by measuring the cross-price elasticity of demand between two products. The cross-price elasticity measures the percentage change in demand for good Y that results from a 1- percent change in good X. The higher is the cross-price elasticity, the more readily consumers substitute between two goods when the price of one good is increased.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How does industry-level price elasticity of demand shape the opportunities for making profit in an industry? How does firm-level price elasticity of demand shape the opportunities for making profit in an industry?</p> Answer <p>The industry price elasticity of demand indicates the percentage change in quantity demanded per percentage change in price when all firms simultaneously change price. It determines the limits on firms' abilities to profit from collective price increases and thus shapes profit opportunities in environments where firms are able to coordinate their pricing behavior to more closely resemble that of a monopolist.  </p> <p>The firm level price elasticity of demand indicates the percentage change in a firms quantity demanded per percentage change in price when that firm changes its price but other competing firms do not. This elasticity will determine the perceived benefits from a price cut aimed at stealing business from competitors. The larger the elasticity is (in absolute value), the stronger the temptation is on the part of a firm to cut price. This elasticity thus shapes industry profitability by influencing the likelihood of destabilizing price-cutting behavior by firms. Thus, the greater the firm-level elasticity of demand, the greater is the potential for price wars and reductions in overall profits.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the \"revenue destruction effect\"? As the number of Cournot competitors in a market increases, the price generally falls. What does this have to do with the revenue destruction effect? Smaller firms often have greater incentives to reduce prices than do larger firms. What does this have to do with the revenue destruction effect?</p> Answer <p>When a firm expands its output, it reduces the market price and thus lowers the sales revenue of its rivals\u2014this is referred to at the \"revenue destruction effect\". Each firm seeks to maximize its own profit and not total industry profit. The smaller is a firm\u2019s share of industry sales, the greater the divergence between its private gain and the revenue destruction effect from output expansion. This suggests that as the number of firms in an industry exhibiting Cournot competition increases, the greater is the divergence between the Cournot equilibrium and the collusive outcome.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Numerous studies have shown that there is usually a systematic relationship between concentration and price. What is this relationship? Offer two brief explanations for this relationship.</p> Answer <p>Leonard Weiss summarized he results of price and concentration studies in over 20 industries, including cement, railroad freight, supermarkets, and gasoline retailing. He finds that with few exceptions, prices tend to be higher in concentrated markets. Consider an industry with a high concentration ratio because there are a small number of Cournot competitors. If each firm\u2019s share of industry sales is large, the divergence between a firm\u2019s private gain and the revenue destruction effect from output expansion is small. Hence, total industry output and price are closer to the levels that would be chosen by a profit-maximizing monopolist. Alternatively, an industry with a high concentration ratio that has a small number of sellers is able to engage more successfully in tacit collusion.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What factors, besides the number of firms in the market, might affect margins?</p> Answer <p>An important source of variations in price-cost margins across industries is due to regulation, product differentiation, the nature of sales transactions, and the concentration of buyers. Also, it is difficult to control for the way in which price cost margins are calculated. Since the predictions of economic theory pertain to the market between price and marginal cost, price-cost margins should be computed using marginal cost. However, accounting cost data usually allow the researcher to infer average cost rather than marginal cost.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>The following are the approximate market shares of different brands of soft drinks during the 1980\u2019s:</p> <ul> <li>Coke 40%</li> <li>Pepsi 30%</li> <li>7-Up 10%</li> <li>Dr. Pepper 10%</li> <li>All other brands 10% </li> </ul> <p>Compute the Herfindahl for the soft drink market. Suppose Pepsi acquired 7-Up. Compute the most merger Herfindahl. What assumptions did you make? Federal antitrust agencies would be concerned to see a Herfindahl increase of the magnitude you computed in (a), and might challenge the merger. Pepsi could respond by offering a different market definition. What market definitions might they propose? Why would this change the Herfindahl?</p> Answer <ol> <li>0.4^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.1^2 + 0.1^2 = Herfindahl index = 0.16+0.09+0.01+0.01 = 0.27     If Pepsi and 7-Up merged:     0.4^2 + 0.4^2 + 0.1^2 = Herfindahl index = 0.16+0.16+0.01 = 0.33     The assumptions of the above include that the market shares of firms in the industry do not change as a result of the merger of two players (Pepsi and 7-Up).</li> <li>Pepsi should consider a market definition that would cause the market shares of firms to appear more fragmented. That is, Pepsi should attempt to increase the size of the denominator that determines its market share. For example, Pepsi might argue that the market definition is the \"junk food market\" \u2013 which includes chips and candy. This would have the affect of making the market Pepsi competes in more fragmented.</li> </ol> <p>Question</p> <p>What indices can be used to measure market concentration?</p> Answer <p>The N-firm concentration ratio tells the combined market share of the largest N players of a market. This index increases with the number of N.</p> <p>The Herfindahl index tells the potentiais the sum of the squares of the market shares of the firms of a market. The square factor attributes more value to larger firms, while smaller firms are penalized.</p> <p>The Herfindahl index in a market with N equal-size firms is 1/N. For example, a market with a Herfindhahl index of 0.20 is about as competitive as a market with 5 equal-sized firms, whether or not there are exactly 5 firms in the market.</p> <p>When calculating a Herfindahl, it is sufficient to restrict attention to firms with market shares of 0.01 or larger, since the squared shares of smaller firms are too small to affect the Herfindahl.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>\"The only way to succeed in a market with homogeneous products is to produce more efficiently than most other firms.\" Does this imply that efficiency is less important in oligopoly and monopoly markets?</p> Answer <p>Oligopolists and monopolists benefit from an higher bargaining power extracting more surplus from consumers.</p> <p>Efficiency is still important in lowering input costs.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>In what ways are monopolistically competitive markets \"monopolistic\"? In what ways are they \"competitive\"?</p> Answer <p>They are competitive as they offer similar products horizontally differentiated, but are considered monopolistic as the strategic decisions of a player don't influence another one's business.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#entry-and-exit", "title": "Entry and exit", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following is a method a monopolist firm might use to prevent entry into a market?</p> <ol> <li>Limit pricing</li> <li>Predatory pricing</li> <li>Capacity expansion</li> <li>All of the above</li> <li>None of the above</li> </ol> Answer <p>1        </p> <p>Question</p> <p>\"All else equal, an incumbent would prefer blockaded entry to deterable entry.\"  Comment.</p> Answer <p>Entry is blockaded if the incumbent need not undertake any entry-deterring strategies to deter entry. Blockaded entry may result when there are structural entry barriers, perhaps because production requires significant fixed investments. Blockaded entry may also result if the entrant expects unfavorable postentry competition, perhaps because the entrant\u2019s product is undifferentiated from those of the incumbents.  </p> <p>Entry is deterred if the incumbent can keep the entrant out by employing entry- deterring strategies, such as limit pricing, predatory pricing and capacity expansion. Moreover, the cost of the entry-deterring strategy is more than offset by the additional profits that the incumbent enjoys in the less competitive environment. However, entry- deterring strategies are generally met with various degrees of success.  </p> <p>Control of essential resources, economies of scale and scope, and marketing advantages of incumbency are types of entry barriers. The firm who is able to use one or a combination of these entry barriers to blockade entry does not have to actively guard itself against entry and so can focus on other activities. If entry is deterred rather than blockaded, the incumbent must actively engage in predatory acts to discourage entry. A threat of entry will most definitely constrain the incumbent. Given the incumbent might prefer to be passive rather than active about discouraging entry, blockaded entry would be preferable to deterable entry.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Explain why economies of scale do not protect incumbents from hit-and-run entry unless the associated fixed costs are sunk. Does the learning curve limit contestability?</p> Answer <p>If the firm\u2019s investments are nonsunk, this suggests the firm can exit and recover the costs of its investments. This reduces the risk associated with entry and, therefore, increases the likelihood of hit-and-run entry. If the firm enjoys lower costs as a result of the learning curve, the market is less likely to be contestable. The learning firm\u2019s enjoy as a by-product of one production process are unlikely to be applicable to other processes \u2013 hence the learning is tied to this particular activity. Since the learning cannot leave the activity, hit-and-run entry is less attractive.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How a firm behaves toward existing competitors is a major determinant of whether it will face entry by new competitors. Explain.</p> Answer <p>If a firm is \"tough\" towards existing competitors (for example, the firm is involved in price or non-price competition), the firm will face less entry because entrants will expect lower profits than if the incumbent were more tolerant of entry. However, if the incumbent has a \"soft\" stance towards the existing competitors, the entrant may take this a signal for some accommodation of entry and thus the entry rate could be higher. The incumbent signals what post-entry competition will be like through its current behavior toward other firms in the industry.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Why is uncertainty a key to the success of entry-deterrence?</p> Answer <p>Entry deterring strategies include limit pricing, predatory pricing and capacity expansions.  </p> <ul> <li>Limit Pricing: If entrants operated in a world of certainty, it would be difficult to find a rational explanation for limit pricing. In general, entering firms must be uncertain about some characteristic of the incumbent firm or the level of market demand. The incumbent wants the entrant to believe that post entry prices will be low. If the entrant is sure about the factors that determine postentry pricing, it can calculate the incumbent\u2019s payoffs from all possible postentry pricing scenarios and correctly forecast the postentry price. If the entrant is uncertain about the postentry price, however, then the incumbent\u2019s pricing strategy could affect the entrant\u2019s expectations.  </li> <li>Predatory Pricing: As with limit pricing, predatory pricing would appear to be irrational if entrants operated under certainty. If, however, entrants lack certainty, then price-cutting by an incumbent may affect the entrants expectations of the incumbent\u2019s future pricing strategies. Operating under uncertainty makes it more difficult for the entrant to rule out a bad postentry scenario and therefore predatory pricing may, indeed, discourage entry.  </li> <li>Excess Capacity: Unlike predatory pricing and limit pricing, excess capacity can deter entry even when the entrant possesses full information about the incumbent\u2019s costs and strategic direction. If the incumbent is holding an entry deterring level of capacity it is actually in the incumbent\u2019s interest to convey this information to would be entrants. If, however, the incumbent is unable to hold an entry-deterring level of investment, then the incumbent might hope the entrant is uncertain about the level of capacity the incumbent actually holds.</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>In most mode of entry deterrence, the incumbent engages in predatory practices that harm a potential entrant. Can these models be reversed, so that the entrant engages in predatory practices? If so then what are the practical differences between incumbents and entrants?</p> Answer <p>Entrants and incumbents roles can be switched in the theoretical models and the results will hold true. If the entrant has deep pockets then it can engage in predatory practices to drive incumbent out. Incumbents have an advantage in that they in most cases would have created brand loyalty or reputation, network externalities, and lower costs due to learning curve. Taking all the above factors into account, it is less likely that entrant will pursue predatory practices.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Consider a firm selling two products, A and B, that substitute for each other. Suppose that an entrant introduces a product that is identical to product A. What factors do you think will affect (a) whether a price war is initiated, and (b) who wins the price war?</p> Answer <p>Given the incumbent is producing two substitute goods, the incumbent has more lose if a price war erupts. The reason is, if the incumbent lowers the price of good A to match the price of the entrant\u2019s identical offering, the incumbent loses revenues on good B as well as on good A because customers who used to purchase B will substitute toward good A. If exit barriers are minimal, the incumbent might prefer to exit the market for good A rather than endure a price war. The incumbent is more likely to stay and fight if exit barriers are high and/or good A and B are weak substitutes. Clearly the probability of a price war decreases if the level of demand for these goods is high relative to the combined capacities of the firms.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>\"Economic theories of how price wars begin presume that firms would prefer their industry price to be high\" Comment.</p> Answer <p>Consider a firm (firm X) whose output is only slightly differentiated from the output of other firms in the industry. If the firm X\u2019s rivals lower their prices, than firm X will loose significant market share and will consequently suffer a reduction in profits. Collectively, the firms in the industry have lower profits after a price reduction\u2014 however, it is possible that even though the total profit pie is smaller, some firms are better off after the price reduction. However, since total industry profits are lower, more firms see their profits decline than see their profits increase\u2014hence, we can presume that, on average, firms prefer industry price to be high.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Why do misreads and misjudgements encourage firms to lower prices?</p> Answer <p>Consider what might happen when two firms are playing tit-for-tat, and there is a chance that a cooperative move is misread an uncooperative one. The firm that misreads the cooperative move as an uncooperative one responds by making an uncooperative move in the next period. The firm lowers price in order to enforce the tit-for-tat strategy. It is possible that a firm mistakes the actions of its rival as aggressive and so reacts with a price cut in order to protect volume.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Firms operating at or near capacity are unlikely to instigate price wars. Briefly explain.</p> Answer <p>Firms who lower price earn less on every unit they sell up to the quantity they sold before the price reduction. However, this loss can be offset by an increase in units sold due to the now lower price. If a firm is at or near capacity, its ability to expand quantity sold is constrained and hence the firm cannot recover the forgone profits from selling each unit at a lower margin. The capacity constrained firm has little incentive to initiate a price reduction.  </p> <p>Firms are more likely to instigate price wars when excess capacity exists. For example, if a firm is experiencing excess capacity, and a new firm enters the market, the new entry will induce even greater excess capacity on the part of the incumbent. If there are economies of scale in production, the costs of idle capacity may rise with the degree of idleness. This suggests that the incumbent will fight harder to retain market share under excess capacity conditions, prices are likely to drop with entry. The firm with excess capacity may lower its price in order to retain or steal market share.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Suppose that you were an industry analyst trying to determine if the leading firms in the automobile manufacturing industry are playing a tit-for-tat pricing game. What real world data would you want to examine? What would you consider to be evidence of tit-for-tat pricing?</p> Answer <p>Circumstantial evidence of tit-for-tat pricing is relatively easy to find. Public pricing behavior like the advance announcement of price changes and the use of commitments to meet the lowest available price support price coordination and stability, as does simplified pricing behavior such as having annual pricing reviews. However, hard evidence of tit-for-tat pricing is much harder to come by, unless firms are foolish enough to put a collusive agreement in writing.  </p> <p>You would want detailed data on historical prices and firm profits in an attempt to discern pricing patterns that support above-average industry profitability. One such telltale pattern is a punishment strategy, where all firms lower price to \u2018punish\u2019 a renegade firm that reduces its price unilaterally. Then, after a period, all firms raise their price back to the previous, higher level. However, firms can always argue that external circumstances are responsible for the price moves. Furthermore, if collusion is extremely effective, you would not observe punishment behavior at all.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Studies of pricing in the airline industry show that carriers that dominate hub airports (Delta in Atlanta, USAir in Pittsburgh, American in Dallas) tend to charge higher fares, on average, for flights in and out of the hub airport than other, non-dominate, carriers flying in and out of the hub. What might explain this pattern of prices?</p> Answer <p>There are several reasons why dominant hub airlines can charge higher prices than non- dominant carriers flying in and out of the hub. First, the convenience that a hub airline provides creates a differentiated product for which the airline can charge a premium. Second, the frequency that hub airlines provide reduces the number of substitute flights available for consumers. This shifts the demand for the hub airline out, reducing the price elasticity for the hub airline\u2019s flights. And finally, smaller airlines may reduce prices below the hub airline prices because the dominant airline has little incentive to retaliate with a price war.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>It is often argued that price wars may be more likely to occur during low demand periods than during high demand periods. (This chapter makes that argument.) Are there factors that might reverse this implication? That is, can you think of reasons why the attractiveness of deviating from cooperative pricing might actually be greater during booms (high demand) than during busts (low demand)?</p> Answer <p>Deviation from cooperative pricing can occur during economic booms. During periods of high demand, gaining the dominant market share position will capture a higher percentage of industry profits. Also, recognizing the inevitable downturn in their market following a boom period, a firm may be tempted to capture profits to serve as a cushion during an economic downturn. Gaining a dominant market share is more profitable during a boom than during a downturn. Furthermore, if the firm can retain some of it increased share after the boom (through reputational effects, switching costs, etc.) it will be in a better position during the downturn. These factors may tempt a firm to deviate from cooperative pricing during a boom.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which predatory acts can be used to deter potential market entrants? Which ones instead are used to push opponents out of market? Do these actions optimize the actor payoff? Explain why.</p> Answer <p>Limit pricing consist in setting the sell price low enough to make it unprofitable for other players to enter the market.</p> <p>Predatory pricing consist in lowering the sell price under the marginal cost to push an opponent out of market. </p> <p>Actors are better off without applying these strategies, but they still pursue them because there is uncertanty about the future and they hope in limiting competition.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are the factors that an organization should consider when entering a market?

Scale economies affect the number of competitors that can compete successfully in an industry. There are likely to be fewer firms in an industry with high scale economies relative to total industry output than in an industry where scale economies are exhausted at relatively low levels of output. Since there are fewer players, the established incumbents would each have large market share and incur low unit production cost. In this context, scale economies will affect the five forces in the following way.  </p> <ul> <li>Barriers to entry: Scale economies raise the entry barriers. To bring cost to a level comparable to those of existing players, an entrant would have to enter the industry with large capacity and risk strong reaction from the incumbents. An alternative would be to enter at a small scale and face a cost disadvantage. Both options are undesirable to new entrants. </li> <li>Rivalry: Scale economies can have competing effects on rivalry. On the one hand, scale economies may intensify rivalry because the players have the incentive to increase their market share to sustain and deepen their scale economies. Rivalry may take the form of price competition, advertising battles and new product introductions. On the other hand, scale economies may result in fewer firms that could facilitate communication and \"peaceful coexistence\" among industry players. </li> <li>Substitutes: Scale economies increase the threat of the substitute products. If the price-performance trade-off of a substitute product improves, firms within the industry lose share which reduces the industry\u2019s own price-performance trade-off.  </li> <li>Bargaining power of suppliers: If high scale economies result in fewer firms in the industry, it is possible that the bargaining power of suppliers decreases. Fewer firms could co-ordinate their purchases from suppliers, negotiating lower prices and thereby increasing value creation in the industry.  </li> <li>Bargaining power of buyers: Using the same reasoning for supplier power, scale economies that lead to higher industry concentration could decrease the bargaining power of buyers. Fewer firms could co-ordinate their pricing activities, thereby reducing consumer surplus. On the other hand, however, the existence of scale economies increases the power of buyers who purchase very large quantities.</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>How does the magnitude of consumer switching costs affect the intensity of internal rivalry? The extent of entry barriers?</p> Answer <p>The presence of switching costs would reduce the intensity of internal rivalry. Switching costs are costs that consumers incur when they switch from one supplier\u2019s product to another\u2019s. As such, consumers when faced with switching costs would not switch product unless a competitor can offer a major improvement in either price or performance. If switching costs are low, consumers are inclined to switch products when a competitor offers better price or service. This could result in price and service competition that would intensify the rivalry among competitors.  </p> <p>In the presence of consumer switching costs, the bar for entrants is set higher. The entrant may have difficulty attracting consumers away for incumbents. Entrants should expect to more easily attract consumers who have yet to participate in the product vs. the customers of existing firms.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Consider an industry whose demand fluctuates over time. Suppose that this industry faces high supplier power. Briefly state how this high supplier power will affect the variability of profits over time.</p> Answer <p>Given an industry whose demand fluctuates over time and an input supplier with high supplier, the industry\u2019s variability of profits would decrease. High supplier power exists when an input supplier is able to negotiate prices that extract profits from their customers. In this case, the supplier\u2019s power would be reflected in his/her ability to change prices to reflect demand within the customer\u2019s industry over any given period of time.  </p> <p>For example, if the industry is doing well, the supplier could raise prices to extract a share of the industry\u2019s profits. Conversely, if the industry was doing poorly, the supplier could lower prices. The underlying demand volatility would be reflected in the supplier\u2019s profits rather than the industry\u2019s profits. The industry\u2019s profits would stabilize (at a low level).</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What does the concept of \"coopetition\" add to the five forces approach to industry analysis?</p> Answer <p>Coopetition is the concept that the forces that shape industry profits are to a great extent the result of choices made by the individual firms within the industry. As these firms become more savvy regarding the reaction of rivals to their own actions, they will choose actions that reduce the likelihood of losing industry profits to price wars, consumer surplus, and/or ineffective negotiations with suppliers. As each firm comprehends its own role within the industry, firms can collectively fashion strategies which \"cause\" a force to have only a limited effect. If firms ignore the concept of \"coopetition\", they must resign themselves to simply reacting to the industry forces.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Briefly describe the five forces of Porter's model and describe how they can arise strategic issues of an industry.</p> Answer <p>TODO</p>"}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#strategic-position-and-dynamics", "title": "Strategic position and dynamics", "text": ""}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#strategic-positioning-for-competitive-advantage", "title": "Strategic positioning for competitive advantage", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>How can the value chain help a firm identify its strategic position?</p> Answer <p>The value chain is a technique for describing the vertical chain of production. The value chain is also a useful device for thinking about how value is created in an organization. The value chain depicts the firm as a collection of value-creating activities, such as production operations, marketing and distribution, and logistics. Each activity in the value chain can potentially add to the benefit (B) that consumers get from the firm\u2019s product and each can add to the cost (C) that the firm incurs in producing and selling the product.  </p> <p>A firm creates more value than competitors only by performing some or all of these activities better than they do. We can often categorize strategic positions into two broad categories, either a cost advantage or a differentiation advantage. If a firm outperforms other firms in activities that generate superior B (differentiation) or in activities that generate a lower C (cost), the firm\u2019s strategic position should rely on these activities.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Consider a market in which consumer indifference curves are relatively steep. Firms in this industry are pursuing two positioning strategies: some firms are producing a basic product that provides satisfactory performance; others are producing an enhanced product that provides performance that is superior to that of the basic product. Consumer surplus parity currently exists in the industry. Are the prices of the basic and the enhanced product likely to be significantly different or about the same? Why? How would the answer change if the consumer indifference curves were relatively flat?</p> Answer <p>Indifference curves illustrate price-quality combinations that yield the same consumer surplus. The fact that the indifference curve is steep means that consumers are willing to pay significantly more for a good that is of higher quality. Therefore, the prices of the basic and the enhanced product are likely to be significantly different. On the other hand, the prices of the two goods would be about the same if the consumer indifference curves were relatively flat. Flat indifference curves mean that consumers are not willing to pay much more money for a higher benefit.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>In the value-creation model presented in this chapter, it is implicitly assumed that all consumers get the identical value (e.g. identical B) from a given product. Do the main conclusions in this chapter change if consumer tastes differ, so that some get more value than others do?</p> Answer <p>The main conclusions of this chapter are as relevant if consumer tastes differ as when all consumers get identical value. If every consumer obtained a different B from a particular good, there would still exist meaningful segments that would be profitably served by particular firms\u2014rather than each consumer enjoying the same consumer surplus, each would obtain a different surplus. Consumers would purchase as long as their consumer surplus was positive\u2014this is true whether consumers have the same valuation or not. The fact that the level of surplus consumers received was different across consumers does not fundamentally change the analysis.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Identify one or more experience good. Identify one or more search goods. How does the retailing of experience goods differ from the retailing of search goods? Do these differences help consumers?</p> Answer <p>An experience good is a product whose quality can be assessed only after the consumer has actually consumed the product. For example, a buyer could not decide if he likes the taste of a particular beverage until the buyer actually consumes the beverage. Sometimes the product has to be used for a while in order to understand fully how satisfying is consumption of the good. For example, a consumer may not be able to evaluate the quality of his automobile until he has driven that automobile for several weeks.  </p> <p>A search good is one whose objective quality attributes the typical buyer can easily access at the time of purchase. For example, a consumer could determine all the important attributes of a diamond at the time of purchase\u2014wearing the diamond as an owner of the diamond does not generate any additional information.  </p> <p>With search goods, the potential for differentiation lies largely in enhancing the product\u2019s observable features. When a firm is selling a search good that possesses attributes the seller wants the customer to know about, the customer does not have to take the seller at his word\u2014the customer can observe the attributes. The seller must only provide an opportunity for the consumer to fully observe the good. Sellers who do not reveal the attributes of their products at the time of sale will lose sales to sellers who are willing to reveal their products fully to buyers or these sellers would have to heavily discount their prices. The seller\u2019s reputation, however, is not in question\u2014the attributes of the good speak for themselves.  </p> <p>When selling an experience good, sellers must often send signals to buyers that the good will not disappointment the buyer post-purchase. Since the buyer does not get to fully appreciate the good until after the good is consumed, the buyer buys under uncertainty. The seller\u2019s reputation for delivering products that perform as promised becomes an important feature of the purchase process.  The selling processes associated with search and experience goods help insure that consumers purchase goods closer to their \"ideal\" good. Both processes reduce the risks of buying under uncertainty\u2014the attributes of search goods are revealed at the time of purchase and reputation and other credible signals are used to guide consumers in their purchases of experience goods.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Recall from Chapter 2 Adam Smith\u2019s dictum \"The Division of Labor is Limited by the Extent of the Market.\" How does market growth affect the viability of a focus strategy?</p> Answer <p>Under a focus strategy, a firm concentrates either on offering a single product or serving a single market segment or both. Four examples of focus strategies are:  </p> <ul> <li>Product specialization: the firm concentrates on producing a single type of product of a variety of different market segments</li> <li>Geographic specialization: the firm offers a variety of related products within a narrowly defined geographic market</li> <li>Customer specialization: the firm offers a variety of related products to a particular class of customers</li> <li>Niche strategy: a firm produces a single product for a single market segment</li> </ul> <p>The basic economic logic of a focus strategy is that the firm is sometimes able to achieve deep economies of scale by concentrating on a particular segment or a particular product that is would be unable to exploit if it expanded beyond the segment or product it is concentrating on. The growth of a market can make a focus strategy that at one time was not feasible become a very profitable opportunity. Growth might also increase the benefits of economies of scale for the focuser. If a market grows to the point where a firm\u2019s economies of scale are exhausted, the firm might have to worry about entry.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>\"Firms that seek a cost advantage should adopt a learning curve strategy; firms that seek to differentiate their products should not.\" Comment on both of these statements.</p> Answer <p>A learning curve strategy is one in which a firm seeks to reduce costs by learning. This is but one of many ways in which a firm can achieve a cost advantage. Other cost drivers include: economies of scale, economies of scope, capacity utilization, economies of density, process efficiency, government policy, and a firm\u2019s location. Learning curves can also confer quality advantages. If there is a first mover advantage in establishing a particular quality position (say the goods are experience goods), then it may pay to push aggressively down the learning curve to gain that quality advantage. Therefore, pursuing a learning curve strategy could be advantageous to both firms that seek a cost advantage and firms that seek to differentiate their products.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Consumers often identify brand names with quality. Do you think branded products usually are of higher quality than generic products and therefore justify their higher prices? If so, why don\u2019t all generic product makers invest to establish brand identity, thereby enabling them to raise price?</p> Answer <p>Establishing a brand name is very costly for firms. Large sums of capital must be invested continually over a long period of time before a firm earns a significant brand identity. In the sale of experience goods\u2014goods whose quality cannot be assessed before they are purchased and used\u2014the reputation for quality that a firm establishes can be a significant advantage. Consumers can reason that a firm who has invested continually in its brand identity is unlikely to chisel on quality and risk depreciating its precious brand image. In other words, incurring the cost of establishing a brand identity is a means for firms to signal to consumers that the firm offers quality products. Hence, the expectation is that branded products are of higher quality than generic products and should, therefore, garner higher prices.  </p> <p>We should not expect, however, that all sellers of experience goods would brand their goods. For certain goods consumers may be much more price sensitive than quality sensitive. A firm who incurs costly marketing may find itself unable to pass this cost on to customers who do not sufficiently value the signal that the firm is selling a higher quality product.  </p> <p>Also, establishing a brand identity is less attractive to sellers of search goods, or goods whose quality and other attributes can be established at the time of sale. Since the consumer can ascertain the quality of the product directly, signals of quality are not necessary. Hence, sellers of search goods might be better off selling their products under a generic label. Theoretically, a consumer should not pay a premium for a branded search good because the brand name does not confer any additional information.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Consider a market in which consumer indifference curves are relatively steep. Firmsin the industry are pursuing two positioning strategies: some firms are producing a basic productthat provides satisfactory performance; others, are producing an enhanced product that provides perfomance superior to that of the basic product.

How would the answer change if consumer indifference curves were relatively flat?  </p> Answer <p>TODO</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How do economies of scale affect strategic positioning?</p> Answer <p>Economies of scales can allow for a cost leadership positioning.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/io/exam/#information-and-value-creation", "title": "Information and value creation", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Explain how many internet firms create value by solving the \"shopping problem\".</p> Answer <p>The customer\u2019s shopping problem involves searching for the highest difference between the benefits and the price of a good.  </p> <p>This search can have a cost itself, but in recent years it has been lowered by services that allow to compare multiple customers simultaneously.

Within a typical IB organization, a \"Chinese wall\" exists between the investment banking division and the research sales division. This is an information barrier designed to prevent the flow of confidential information between the two divisions and to prevent conflicts of interest. The investment banking division may have access to sensitive information about a client's upcoming transactions or financial performance, while the research sales division provides analysis and recommendations to investors. The Chinese wall helps to ensure that this information is not shared inappropriately and that the research sales division's recommendations are not influenced by the investment banking division's activities.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Arbitrageurs buy the stock and make a profit on the difference between the bid price and the target's current stock price, if the deal is consummated.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>True. Arbitrageurs, also known as risk arbitrageurs or merger arbitrageurs, seek to profit from the price difference between the bid price and the target's current stock price in an M&amp;A transaction. If the deal is consummated, the target's stock price will typically rise to the bid price, allowing the arbitrageur to sell their shares at a profit. However, if the deal falls through, the target's stock price may decline, resulting in a loss for the arbitrageur. This strategy is known as merger arbitrage or risk arbitrage and involves taking on a certain level of risk in order to potentially generate a profit.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#types-of-acquisitionstakeovers-and-motivation-for-ma", "title": "Types of acquisitions/takeovers and motivation for M&amp;A", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Rising stock market and the type of transaction (horizontal, vertical, conglomerate, strategic, financial) are similar among merger waves?</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. Merger waves are periods of increased merger and acquisition activity.

A conglomerate is a type of merger where two or more companies that operate in unrelated business areas combine their assets and income streams in order to diversify their operations and reduce risk. This type of merger is not focused on achieving economies of scale or scope or controlling supply or distribution channels, but rather on diversifying the company's operations.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following common managers' needs represent motivations to pursue M&amp;As which are not always  in the best interest of the firm or shareholders?</p> <ul> <li> Increasing operational efficiency and profitability</li> <li> Decreasing leverage ratio</li> <li> Reducing firm risk through diversification</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> Answer <p>Reducing firm risk through diversification can represent a motivation for managers to pursue mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) that is not always in the best interest of the firm or its shareholders. While diversification can help to reduce a firm's overall risk by spreading its investments across multiple industries or markets, it can also dilute the firm's focus and expertise. In some cases, managers may pursue M&amp;As for the purpose of diversification without fully considering the potential impact on the firm's core business or its shareholders. Increasing operational efficiency and profitability and decreasing leverage ratio, on the other hand, are generally considered to be in the best interest of the firm and its shareholders.</p> <p>Additionally, shareholders can reduice their risk by themselves by diversifying their capital investments. </p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following is not a value creation motivation for M&amp;A?</p> <ul> <li> Reducing average issuing costs</li> <li> Using tax deduction in a higher tax bracket to obtain a large tax shield</li> <li> Making use of unused production, sales or marketing capacity</li> <li> Increasing production capacity to consolidate the number of firms in the industry</li> </ul> Answer <p>Increasing production capacity to consolidate the number of firms in the industry.

If the products of two companies are easily substitutable for each other, it does not necessarily mean that the two companies have high \"customer sharing.\" Customer sharing refers to the degree to which customers purchase products from multiple companies within the same market. While product substitutability can be a factor in customer sharing, other factors such as brand loyalty, marketing, and customer service can also play a role.

In common law system caveat emptor is the traditional principle, which states how there is no obligation for the seller to disclose possible liabilities that may occur after the sale, so it is up to the purchaser to find possible issues.</p> <p>However, vendor due diligence is convenient for the seller, because if you are aware of your issues you can try to disclose them and to negotiate on them, while if instead you are not aware of them, during the shareholder purchase agreement some \"penalties\" for the seller could arise, because the idea is the one that the buyer has more knowledge than you. From the seller\u2019s point of view it is also important to have knowledge of possible liabilities and try to agree with the purchaser on disclosed liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification obligations of the Seller.

In order to conduct a thorough and effective due diligence process, the professionals involved must have full knowledge of the deal structure and the business of the target company. This knowledge allows them to identify the key areas of risk and opportunity and to focus their due diligence efforts on those areas. Without this knowledge, the due diligence process may be less effective and may not uncover all of the relevant information needed to make an informed decision about the proposed transaction.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>As buy-side financial advisor you should always have the seller signing the NDA before you provide the Information Memorandum.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False.

A Letter of Intent and a term sheet are similar in that they both outline the key terms of a proposed M&amp;A between two parties and they are usually non-binding. Usually Term Sheets are more informal than LOI as they are structured as bullet points and sometimes they are not even signed, and the parties agree on their contents and without signing it they just go to the next step.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>In which of the following activities of the due diligence process from the purchaser point of view should be taken into account?</p> <ul> <li> Interview the seller or its management going through the due diligence request list to understand what request is applicable and what are the most sensitive areas where the purchaser should focus its activity</li> <li> Keeping track of all the Q&amp;A and coordinating with the other advisors in order to properly tailor the SPA</li> <li> Send a due diligence request list to the seller or its advisors</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> Answer <p>All of the above. From the purchaser's point of view, the due diligence process should take into account all of the following: interviewing the seller or its management going through the due diligence request list to understand what request is applicable and what are the most sensitive areas where the purchaser should focus its activity, keeping track of all the Q&amp;A and coordinating with the other advisors in order to properly tailor the SPA, and sending a due diligence request list to the seller or its advisors.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>In an M&amp;A process a potential purchaser will make a final decision on the basis of the Information Memorandum.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. While the Information Memorandum is an important document that provides detailed information about the target company to potential buyers, it is unlikely that a potential purchaser will make a final decision solely on the basis of the Information Memorandum. The final decision to proceed with an acquisition typically involves a thorough due diligence process, where the potential buyer conducts a detailed analysis of the target company's financials, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.

Selecting the right approach for a strategic alliance depends on a thorough analysis that includes consideration of the speed and risks involved in the transaction, definition of the benefits and costs, and management commitment to doing what is necessary for success. A strategic alliance is a cooperative arrangement between two or more companies to achieve a common goal.

When the relative strategic importance of a possible alliance is low for one partner and high for another, the partner for whom the alliance is more important may aim to limit its partnership with the other partner to specific opportunities. This can help ensure that the partnership is focused on areas where both partners see value and can help prevent the less interested partner from losing interest in the alliance.

A Transactional Alliance is a type of strategic alliance in which the relationship between the partners is contract-driven and does not involve control. These alliances are typically focused on specific projects or transactions and are governed by contractual agreements that define the rights and obligations of each partner.</p> <p>The first and second statements do not necessarily characterize a Transactional Alliance.

While strategic buyers often look for synergies with the target company to maximize their shareholder's transaction value, financial investors may have different motivations for acquiring a company. Financial investors typically view the acquisition as an investment and aim to grow the company and resell it at a higher value. They may focus more on the financial returns of the investment rather than on achieving synergies with the target company.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Are financial buyers typically more prone to spend time building a comprehensive macro view of the industry compared to strategic buyers?</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>True. Strategic buyers typically operate in the same industry as the target, so they already know the industry well.

Financial buyers and strategic buyers may have different levels of sensitivity to business cycle risk, but it is not necessarily true that financial buyers are less sensitive to business cycle risk than strategic buyers because of their shorter investment horizon. Financial buyers, such as private equity firms, typically have a shorter investment horizon than strategic buyers and may focus on generating returns through financial engineering and operational improvements. However, they may still be sensitive to business cycle risk if their investment strategy relies on favorable market conditions. Strategic buyers, on the other hand, may be more focused on the long-term strategic fit of the target company with their existing business and may be willing to weather short-term business cycle fluctuations.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Is synergy value created from integration economies between the target and a financial buyer?</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. Synergy value is typically created from integration economies between the target and a strategic buyer, not a financial buyer. Integration economies refer to the cost savings and revenue enhancements that can be achieved by combining the operations of two companies. Strategic buyers may be able to realize these synergies by integrating the target company with their existing business. Financial buyers, on the other hand, typically do not have an existing business with which to integrate the target company and may focus on generating returns through financial engineering and operational improvements rather than integration economies.        </p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following is false with refer to the typical private equity fund structure?</p> <ul> <li> The GPs of the partnership are responsible for the day to day management of the partnership investment</li> <li> The GPs of the partnership are not allowed to invest capital in the fund</li> <li> The LPs of the partnership are only providers of capital</li> </ul> Answer <p>The second statement is false. GPs of a private equity fund are typically required to invest some of their own capital in the fund alongside the LPs. This is known as having \"skin in the game\" and helps to align the interests of the GPs with those of the LPs by ensuring that the GPs have a financial stake in the success of the fund.</p> <p>The GPs of the partnership are responsible for the day to day management of the partnership investment The first and third statements are true with respect to the typical private equity fund structure. In a private equity fund, the general partners (GPs) are responsible for the day-to-day management of the partnership's investments. They make investment decisions, monitor the performance of the portfolio companies, and work to generate returns for the fund's investors. The limited partners (LPs) of the partnership are typically passive investors who provide capital to the fund but do not participate in its management.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#target-valuation-and-lbos", "title": "Target valuation and LBOs", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following may be used to value small privately owned firms?</p> <ul> <li> DCF method</li> <li> Comparables companies method</li> <li> Liquidation method</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> Answer <p>All of the above methods may be used to value small privately owned firms:</p> <ul> <li>The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method values a company based on its future cash flows, discounted to their present value.</li> <li>The Comparables Companies method values a company by comparing it to similar companies that have recently been sold or valued.</li> <li>The Liquidation method values a company based on the net realizable value of its assets if it were to be liquidated.</li> </ul> <p>Each method has its own strengths and limitations and the most appropriate method will depend on the specific circumstances of the company being valued.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Looking at the valuation line, from a turnaround/distressed investment perspective, which of the following EV/EBITDA value represents the best multiple as an investment entry point (multiple)?</p> <ul> <li> 3.5x with the valuation going down</li> <li> 2.5x with the valuation going up</li> <li> 2.5x with the valuation going down</li> </ul> Answer <p>From a turnaround/distressed investment perspective, a lower EV/EBITDA multiple may represent a more attractive investment entry point. In this case, a 2.5x EV/EBITDA multiple with the valuation going down could represent the best investment entry point among the options you mentioned. However, it is important to note that the EV/EBITDA multiple is just one factor to consider when evaluating an investment opportunity.

A company's cash flow is typically categorized as cash flows from operations, investing, and financing. Operating cash flow is obtained from EBIT, which is pre-tax operating income.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Focusing on which of the following key areas would improve the valuation of the target in an M&amp;A process?</p> <ul> <li> Strategic strenght</li> <li> Market dynamics</li> <li> Relatedness</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> Answer <p>All of the above. Focusing on strategic strength, market dynamics, and relatedness can all improve the valuation of a target in an M&amp;A process.</p> <ul> <li>Strategic strength: A target company with strong strategic capabilities, such as a unique product or service offering, a strong market position, or valuable intellectual property, may be more attractive to potential acquirers and command a higher valuation.</li> <li>Market dynamics: A target company operating in a growing or attractive market may be more valuable to potential acquirers than one operating in a stagnant or declining market. Understanding the market dynamics and positioning the target company accordingly can help to improve its valuation.</li> <li>Relatedness: A target company that is closely related to the acquirer's existing business may offer greater potential for synergies and value creation. Demonstrating the potential for synergies and relatedness between the target and the acquirer can help to improve the target's valuation.</li> </ul> <p>By focusing on these key areas and highlighting their strengths, a target company can improve its valuation in an M&amp;A process.      </p> <p>Question</p> <p>With regard to the VC method, the required ownership percentage to meet the target rate of return is the amount to be invested by the venture capitalist divided by the terminal value of the company at the year of exit.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False The Venture Capital method is a valuation method used by venture capitalists to determine the pre-money valuation of a startup and the required ownership percentage to meet their target rate of return. The required ownership percentage is calculated by dividing the amount to be invested by the venture capitalist by the present value of the terminal value of the company at the year of exit. This calculation takes into account the venture capitalist's target rate of return and the expected growth rate of the company.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following should be added to the firm equity value in determining the total equity value of the firm?</p> <ul> <li> Surplus land</li> <li> Cash balances in excess of normal operating requirements</li> <li> PV of unused patents</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> Answer <p>All of the above. In determining the total equity value of a firm, surplus land, cash balances in excess of normal operating requirements, and the present value of unused patents should all be added to the firm's equity value.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Which of the following is generally not considered a factor critical to the success of an LBO?</p> <ul> <li> Improving operating performance</li> <li> Large reinvestment requirements to sustain growth</li> <li> Knowing what type of firm you buy</li> <li> Not overpaying for the target firm</li> </ul> Answer <p>Large reinvestment requirements to sustain growth is generally not considered a factor critical to the success of a leveraged buyout (LBO). Factors that are critical to the success of an LBO include improving operating performance, knowing what type of firm you are buying, and not overpaying for the target firm. In an LBO, the acquiring company typically uses a significant amount of debt to finance the purchase of the target company, so it is important to focus on improving cash flow and reducing debt in order to successfully manage the LBO.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Search fund is an innovative asset class with an expected return in the range of:</p> <ul> <li> 40% - 45%</li> <li> 25% - 30%</li> <li> 9% - 12%</li> <li> 4% - 6%</li> </ul> Answer <p>Most search fund have an expected return of 25% - 30%</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Initiating the search process involves the development of as many selection criteria as possible to identify as many potential targets as possible.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>Initiating the search process for potential targets in a merger or acquisition involves developing specific and well-defined selection criteria to identify the most suitable targets, rather than as many targets as possible. Having too many selection criteria or identifying too many potential targets can make the search process inefficient and unfocused. It is important to have a clear understanding of the strategic objectives of the merger or acquisition and to develop selection criteria that align with those objectives in order to identify the most suitable targets.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#traditional-vs-distressed-ma", "title": "Traditional vs. distressed M&amp;A", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>If you had the opportunity to choose between \"asset deal\" (purchase of an asset) and \"share deal\" (share transaction) to acquire the same company, you would prefer the first because:</p> <ul> <li> Due diligence on assets will be less expensive</li> <li> The reference enterprise value will be lower</li> <li> The buyer will avoid some contingent liabilities</li> </ul> Answer <p>The buyer will avoid some contingent liabilities. The choice between an asset deal and a share deal depends on the specific circumstances of the acquisition. However, one reason a buyer might prefer an asset deal is that it can allow the buyer to avoid some contingent liabilities associated with the target company. In an asset deal, the buyer can choose which assets and liabilities to acquire, whereas in a share deal, the buyer acquires all assets and liabilities of the target company.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>A tender offer involving cash for total stock is called an exchange offer.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. A tender offer involving cash for total stock is not called an exchange offer. An exchange offer is a type of tender offer in which the acquiring company offers to exchange its own securities for the securities of the target company. In contrast, a tender offer involving cash for total stock is a cash tender offer, where the acquiring company offers to purchase the target company's shares for cash.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Representations and Warranties are very important when the Purchaser is \"buying a box\" because:</p> <ul> <li> It wants to be sure of the content of the box</li> <li> Some essential aspects of the target cannot always be covered by the due diligence</li> <li> It does not know the value of the shares</li> </ul> Answer <p>It wants to be sure of the content of the box. With representations and warranties the seller provides assurances about the condition and accuracy of the undisclosed or undiscovered aspects. The buyer wants to be sure that the content of the box (for which he is paying the purchase price) is warranted. Hence the need of regulating aspects such as purchase price adjustments, interim management, representations and warranties and indemnities.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>A company which is not able to meet its obligations and reimbursement schedule does not look attractive for distressed investors.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. Distressed investors are investors who specialize in investing in companies that are in financial distress and are unable to meet their obligations and reimbursement schedules. These investors see potential value in these companies and believe that they can turn them around and generate a return on their investment. While a company that is unable to meet its obligations may not be attractive to traditional investors, it may be attractive to distressed investors who have the expertise and resources to help the company recover.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Most SMEs are largely financed through bank debt from several institutions, in many cases such minor exposure drives lack of attention and control by banks, leading to further extension of credit and fresh money to SMEs in distressed situations.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>True. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are largely financed through bank debt from several institutions. However, in many cases, such minor exposure can lead to a lack of attention and control by banks. This can result in further extension of credit and fresh money to SMEs in distressed situations.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>If a company has both:</p> <ul> <li>Asset Value &lt; Debt</li> <li>Sustainable debt &lt; Actual debt</li> </ul> <p>It often means that:</p> <ul> <li> Debt coverage &gt; 2</li> <li> Interest coverage &gt; 5</li> <li> Debt service coverage ratio &lt; 1</li> </ul> Answer <p> If a company has both Asset Value &lt; Debt and Sustainable debt &lt; Actual debt, it often means that the Debt service coverage ratio &lt; 1. The Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) is a measure of a company's ability to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt obligations. A DSCR of less than 1 indicates that the company is not generating enough cash flow to cover its debt obligations. In this case, the company's asset value is less than its debt and its sustainable debt is less than its actual debt, indicating that the company may be in financial distress and may not be able to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt obligations.        </p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#the-investor-perspective", "title": "The investor perspective", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>What is the expected recovery rate by the subordinated debt holders, given:</p> <ul> <li>Enterprise Value = 90M\u20ac</li> <li>Senior Debt = 75M\u20ac</li> <li> <p>Subordinated Debt = 50M\u20ac</p> </li> <li> <p> 30%</p> </li> <li> 40%</li> <li> 55%</li> <li> None of the others</li> </ul> Answer <p>In this scenario, the expected recovery rate for the subordinated debt holders would be 30%. The recovery rate is the percentage of the outstanding debt that is expected to be recovered in the event of a default. In this case, the EV of the company is 90M\u20ac and the Senior Debt is 75M\u20ac. Since senior debt holders have priority over subordinated debt holders in the event of a default, the senior debt holders would be paid first from the Enterprise Value. This would leave 90M\u20ac - 75M\u20ac = 15M\u20ac remaining to pay the subordinated debt holders. However, since the subordinated debt is 50M\u20ac, there would not be enough funds remaining to pay the subordinated debt. In fact, the expected recovery rate for the subordinated debt holders would be only 15M\u20ac / 50M\u20ac = 30%.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Financial debt is sustainable when:</p> <ul> <li> Debt Cover Ratio &lt; 1</li> <li> Debt Service Coverage Ratio &gt; 1</li> <li> Interest Cover Ratio &lt; 4</li> <li> None of the above</li> </ul> Answer <p>Financial debt is considered sustainable when the DSCR is higher than 1. Debt Service Coverage Ratio is a measure of a company's ability to generate enough cash flow to cover its debt obligations. A DSCR of higher than 1 indicates that the company is generating enough cash flow to cover its debt payments. A DSCR of less than 1, on the other hand, indicates that the company may have difficulty meeting its debt obligations and may be at risk of default.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Expected return on senior unsecured debt is higher than that on convertible debt.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. The expected return on senior unsecured debt is typically lower than that on convertible debt. Senior unsecured debt is a type of debt that is not secured by any collateral and is ranked higher in the capital structure than subordinated debt. This means that in the event of a default, holders of senior unsecured debt are paid before holders of subordinated debt. Convertible debt, on the other hand, is a type of debt that can be converted into equity at a predetermined price. Because of the conversion feature, convertible debt typically carries a lower interest rate than senior unsecured debt.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>Because of the shorter term of reimbursement and the granting of collateral, bridge loans are less risky that term loans.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. Bridge loans are generally considered to be riskier than term loans due to their short-term nature and relatively high interest rates. While bridge loans may have a shorter term of reimbursement and may require collateral, they tend to have a faster application, approval, and funding process than traditional loans. In exchange for the convenience, these loans tend to have relatively short terms, high interest rates, and large origination fees. Bridge loans are best for borrowers who expect to repay the loan quickly, such as when they expect their current home to sell quickly.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#corporate-restructuring", "title": "Corporate Restructuring", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Often financial restructuring is linked to business turnaround. In such situations can equity investment risk be hedged by the purchasing of credits (e.g. bank debt) if the value of such credits is still at par (its nominal value)?</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> Answer <p>False. Financial restructuring is often linked to business turnaround, but purchasing credits (e.g. bank debt) at par value would not hedge the risk of an equity investment. Hedging involves taking an offsetting position in a related security to mitigate the risk of an investment. In this case, purchasing credits at par value would not offset the risk of an equity investment in a company undergoing financial restructuring and business turnaround. Instead, the risk of the equity investment could potentially be hedged through other means such as purchasing put options or short selling.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#case-studies", "title": "Case studies", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Food supplements and traditional foods are:</p> <ul> <li> One business with potential for differentiation or niche position</li> <li> One business with potential for substitution</li> <li> Separate businesses with potential for bundling</li> <li> Separate businesses</li> </ul> Answer <p>Food supplements and traditional foods can be considered as separate businesses with potential for bundling.

This is particularly important in the context of M&amp;A, where investment bankers may have access to confidential information about a corporation that they are advising on a potential merger or acquisition.</p> <p>The Chinese wall helps to prevent conflicts of interest and insider trading by ensuring that confidential information is not shared between different divisions or departments within the investment bank. For example, if an investment banker is advising a corporation on a potential merger, they may have access to confidential information about the corporation's financials, operations, or strategic plans. This information could be valuable to other divisions within the investment bank, such as traders or research analysts, but it would be inappropriate for them to have access to it. The Chinese wall helps to prevent this by ensuring that confidential information is kept separate and not shared between different divisions.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the key roles and responsibilities of an investment banker in an M&amp;A transaction?</p> Answer <p>An investment banker plays a crucial role in an M&amp;A transaction by providing strategic advice and assistance to companies involved in the deal. Some of the key roles and responsibilities of an investment banker in an M&amp;A transaction include:</p> <ul> <li>Providing strategic advice: Investment bankers help companies evaluate their strategic options and determine whether an M&amp;A transaction is in their best interests. They may also help companies identify potential acquisition targets or merger partners.</li> <li>Assisting with valuation: Investment bankers help companies determine the value of potential acquisition targets or merger partners. This involves conducting financial analysis and due diligence to assess the target's financials, operations, and future prospects.</li> <li>Structuring the deal: Investment bankers help companies structure the terms of an M&amp;A transaction in a way that is beneficial for all parties involved. This may involve negotiating the price and other terms of the deal, as well as determining how it will be financed.</li> <li>Facilitating the transaction: Investment bankers play a key role in facilitating an M&amp;A transaction by coordinating with other parties involved in the deal such as lawyers, accountants, and regulators. They also help prepare necessary documentation and filings.</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the key roles and players in an investment bank, and how do they interact with each other?</p> Answer <p>Some of the key roles and players in an investment bank include investment bankers, who provide strategic advisory services and assist companies in raising capital; research analysts, who provide analysis and forecasts on companies, industries, and markets; salespeople, who act as intermediaries between clients and traders; traders, who provide liquidity for securities; and others such as asset managers, private client services professionals, and capital markets specialists.</p> <p>These different roles and players interact with each other in various ways. For example, research analysts may provide their analysis and forecasts to investment bankers, salespeople, and traders to help them make informed decisions. Investment bankers may work closely with research analysts to gain insights into companies and markets. Salespeople may use research reports from analysts to help inform their clients' investment decisions. Traders may use research analysis to help inform their trading strategies.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the different types of securities that an investment bank might deal with?</p> Answer <p> Investment banks deal with a variety of securities, including debt securities, equity securities, derivative securities, and hybrid securities. Here are some examples of the different types of securities that investment banks might deal with:</p> <p>Debt securities: These are financial instruments that represent a loan made by an investor to a borrower, such as a government or corporation. Examples of debt securities include bonds, notes, and commercial paper.</p> <p>Equity securities: These are financial instruments that represent ownership in a company. Examples of equity securities include common stock and preferred stock.</p> <p>Derivative securities: These are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset, such as a stock or commodity. Examples of derivative securities include options, futures, and swaps.</p> <p>Hybrid securities: These are financial instruments that combine characteristics of both debt and equity securities. Examples of hybrid securities include convertible bonds and preferred stock.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is an IPO, and what role do investment banks play in this process?</p> Answer <p> An initial public offering (IPO) is the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance for the first time. The purpose of an IPO is to raise equity capital from public investors. Investment banks play a crucial role in the IPO process by serving as intermediaries between corporations and investors. Here are some of the roles that investment banks play in the IPO process:</p> <ul> <li>Underwriting: Investment banks provide underwriting services for new stock issues when a company decides to go public and seeks equity funding. Underwriting involves the investment bank purchasing an agreed-upon number of shares of the new stock, which it then resells through a stock exchange. Part of the investment bank's job is to evaluate a company and determine a reasonable price at which to offer stock shares. IPOs, especially for larger companies, commonly involve a pool of banks (syndicate). This way, the risk of underwriting is spread across several banks, reducing the exposure of any single bank and requiring a relatively lower financial commitment to the IPO.        </li> <li>Financial Advisory: Investment banks also provide financial advisory services to companies going public. This includes helping the company prepare for the IPO, advising on the timing and pricing of the offering, and assisting with regulatory compliance.        </li> <li>Coordination: The IPO process requires coordination across a large team of involved parties, including the company\u2019s management, legal counsel, auditors, underwriters, and underwriters\u2019 legal counsel. Investment banks play a key role in coordinating these parties and ensuring that the IPO process runs smoothly.        </li> <li>Marketing: Investment banks also help market the IPO to potential investors. This involves creating a prospectus that provides information about the company and the offering, and distributing it to potential investors.        </li> <li>Stabilization: After the IPO, investment banks may engage in stabilizing activities to support the stock price. This may involve purchasing additional shares in the market to maintain stability and prevent excessive volatility.</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the key factors that make M&amp;A transactions relevant?</p> Answer <p>M&amp;A transactions are relevant for several factors. They involve a crossroad of skills and academic tools such as strategy, finance, marketing, accounting, language, and culture. They also involve key assets of a business such as brand, know-how, technology, HR, cost structure, organization, management, financial structure, shareholders\u2019 value and objectives. M&amp;A transactions are essential to business development and are part of a company\u2019s life cycle. They are influenced by economic cycles and macro-economic factors.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the key roles and players in the M&amp;A marketplace?</p> Answer <p>The M&amp;A marketplace is divided into two parts by the Chinese wall. On one side are the insiders who have private information about the corporation, such as the corporation itself and investment bankers. On the other side is the area with public information, which includes investors, brokers, portfolio managers, institutional sales, analysts, and others.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How does information flow between investment bank divisions and clients?</p> Answer <p>Information flows between investment bank divisions and clients through various channels such as research reports, strategic advice from investment bankers, sales and trading services from salespeople and traders, and capital markets services from equity capital markets, fixed income markets, and syndicate teams.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the role of research in investment banks?</p> Answer <p>Research plays an important role in investment banks by providing quantitative, strategic, and tactical research on companies and their industries. This includes forecasting stock price performance and corporate financial results for companies within their coverage responsibility. Research can also provide global economic analysis for clients as well as employees of the investment bank. This includes analyzing economic data such as leading economic indicators and assessing the likelihood, timing, and impact of interest rate changes.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the roles of sales &amp; trading within an investment bank?</p> Answer <p>Sales &amp; trading within an investment bank provides execution and liquidity to institutional investors by offering a full array of cash, financing, derivative, and research products across various asset classes. Sales forces identify clients' needs and utilize the firm's resources to meet these needs while traders provide liquidity for securities around the globe.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the strategic advisory services provided by investment bankers?</p> Answer <p>Investment bankers can provide strategic advisory services on matters such as mergers &amp; acquisitions; sales of companies or assets; divestitures such as spin-offs or equity carve-outs; restructuring such as financial or strategic restructuring; stock buybacks; or other strategic matters.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What were some of the factors that contributed to merger waves?</p> Answer <p>The factors that contributed to merger waves included shocks in different sectors such as technological change, deregulation, and escalating commodity prices; ample liquidity available in the market and low cost of capital; overvaluation of acquirer share prices relative to target share prices. It is important to anticipate M&amp;A waves because financial markets reward firms pursuing promising opportunities early on and penalize those that follow later in the cycles.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#types-of-acquisitionstakeovers-and-motivation-for-ma_1", "title": "Types of acquisitions/takeovers and motivation for M&amp;A", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Describe what are the most common factors influencing cross-border M&amp;A decisions. Provide one or more examples of advantages and synergies in cross-border acquisitions among recent deal you read of.</p> Answer <p>There are several factors that can influence cross-border M&amp;A decisions. Some of the most common factors include:</p> <ul> <li>Market conditions: Companies may pursue cross-border M&amp;A to enter new markets or diversify their operations in response to saturation or slowdown in their core markets.</li> <li>Regulatory environment: Companies may pursue cross-border M&amp;A to mitigate regulatory uncertainty or high repatriation costs in their home markets.</li> <li>Technology and productivity enhancement synergies: Companies may pursue cross-border M&amp;A to access new technologies or enhance their productivity through synergies with the target company.</li> <li>Value creation: Companies may pursue cross-border M&amp;A to create value through economies of scale, cost savings, or increased market power.</li> <li>Strategic reasons: Companies may pursue cross-border M&amp;A for strategic reasons, such as to acquire new capabilities or expand their product or service offerings.</li> </ul> <p>One example of an advantage/synergy in cross-border acquisitions is the acquisition of Arm Holdings by NVIDIA Corporation in 2020.

The acquisition allowed NVIDIA to gain access to Arm's technology and expertise in the semiconductor industry, which complemented NVIDIA's existing business in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. The acquisition also allowed NVIDIA to expand its presence in the UK and Europe, which could help the company gain access to new markets and customers.</p> <p>Another example is Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The acquisition is worth $68.7 billion, making it Microsoft's largest acquisition in the company's history.

Moreover, Microsoft will take over many of Activision's publishing studios, which have talented and dedicated gaming developers, allowing them to give gamers access to more games and devices. </p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the key considerations for a company when deciding whether to pursue organic growth or growth through M&amp;A?</p> Answer <p>When deciding whether to pursue organic growth or growth through M&amp;A, a company must consider a number of factors. Organic growth refers to growing the business through internal means such as expanding operations, increasing sales, or developing new products. Growth through M&amp;A, on the other hand, involves acquiring another company or merging with it to achieve growth.</p> <p>Some of the key considerations for a company when deciding between these two options include the potential for synergies, the availability of suitable acquisition targets, the cost of capital, the company's existing capabilities and resources, and the potential risks and challenges associated with each option. For example, if a company has strong internal capabilities and resources, it may be able to achieve growth more effectively through organic means. On the other hand, if there are significant potential synergies to be gained through an acquisition or merger, this may be a more attractive option.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the difference between a friendly takeover and a hostile takeover? How does the process differ between the two?</p> Answer <p>A friendly takeover is when the target company is willing to be acquired and actively cooperates with the acquiring company. In a friendly takeover, the target company may provide access to confidential information to facilitate the due diligence process, and the two companies work together to structure the deal to their mutual satisfaction.</p> <p>In contrast, a hostile takeover is when the target company has no desire to be acquired and actively resists the acquiring company's attempts to take control. In a hostile takeover, the acquiring company may have to slowly acquire a significant stake in the target company through open market purchases before making a tender offer for the remaining shares. The target company may also employ various defensive tactics to try to prevent the takeover.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the defensive tactics that a target company might employ in a hostile takeover situation?</p> Answer <p> Here are some defensive tactics that can be used in a hostile takeover:</p> <ul> <li>Shareholder Rights Plan (Poison Pill): can take different forms, but often gives non-acquiring shareholders the right to buy 50% more shares at a discount price in the event of a takeover;</li> <li>Selling the Crown Jewels: the selling of a target company\u2019s key assets that the acquiring company is most interested in to make it less attractive for takeover. It can involve a large dividend to remove excess cash from the target\u2019s balance sheet;</li> <li>White Knight: look for another friendly acquirer.</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the motivations for cross-border M&amp;A?</p> Answer <p> Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) can be motivated by a variety of factors from a buyer's perspective. Here are some of the motivations behind M&amp;As from a buyer's perspective:</p> <ul> <li>Acquire new technology/expertise: A buyer may be motivated to acquire a company in order to gain access to new technology or expertise that can help them improve their products or services.</li> <li>Economies of scale: A buyer may be motivated to acquire a company in order to achieve economies of scale, which can help them reduce costs and increase efficiency.</li> <li>Market share: A buyer may be motivated to acquire a company in order to increase their market share and gain a competitive advantage in their industry.</li> <li>Diversification: A buyer may be motivated to acquire a company in order to diversify their product base or gain access to new markets.</li> <li>Access to unique assets: A buyer may be motivated to acquire a company in order to gain access to unique assets that cannot be obtained through other methods.</li> <li>Incentives for managers: Sometimes, mergers are primarily motivated by the personal interests and goals of the top management of a company. For example, a company created as a result of a merger guarantees more power and prestige that can be viewed favorably by managers.</li> <li>Synergies: perhaps it's the most important reason for M&amp;As in general. The value of the combined assets of the two companies is greater than the sum of the stand alone value of the same assets. </li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the difference between a horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate merger?</p> Answer <p>A horizontal merger is when two firms in the same industry combine, often to achieve economies of scale or scope. A vertical merger is when one firm acquires a supplier or another firm that is closer to its existing customers, often to control supply or distribution channels. A conglomerate merger is when two firms in unrelated businesses combine, often to diversify the company by combining uncorrelated assets and income streams.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the different types of takeover?</p> Answer <p>Some of the different types of takeover include friendly takeovers where the target company is willing to be acquired; hostile takeovers where the target company has no desire to be acquired; cash transactions where shareholders receive cash for their shares; share transactions where shareholders receive shares or a combination of cash and shares; and going-private transactions where a majority shareholder makes an offer for the remaining listed shares.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>What are some ways in which shareholder value can be increased?</p> Answer <p>There are different ways in which shareholder value can be increased. These include solo ventures or organic growth; partnering through marketing/distribution alliances, joint ventures, licensing, franchising, and equity investments; mergers and acquisitions; minority investments in other firms; financial restructuring; and operational restructuring. The choice among these alternatives depends on the goals of the company, the compatibility between the company and a potential target, the availability of organizational resources to manage a complex deal such as an M&amp;A, and the potential synergies.</p> <p>Question</p> <p>How can value be created through M&amp;A?</p> Answer <p>Value can be created through M&amp;A by generating synergies through economies of scale or scope; improving efficiency by accessing production assets at a lower cost; acquiring strategic or critical assets such as know-how or technology; entering new markets or tapping new customers; diversifying risk by combining uncorrelated assets and income streams; or achieving other strategic goals. M&amp;A can also create value by allowing companies to reorganize their assets, increase shareholder value, and achieve other financial benefits.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#strategic-approach-to-ma-and-key-competitive-analysis-frameworks_1", "title": "Strategic approach to M&amp;A and key competitive analysis frameworks", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>What are some of the key factors that can influence the success or failure of an M&amp;A transaction?</p> Answer <p>&lt;!-- There are many factors that can influence the success or failure of an M&amp;A transaction. Some of the key factors include:</p> <ul> <li>Strategic fit: The strategic fit between the two companies involved in the transaction is crucial for its success. This includes factors such as complementary products or services, compatible corporate cultures, and shared strategic goals.</li> <li>Synergies: The potential for synergies, or cost savings and revenue enhancements resulting from the combination of the two companies, is another important factor. Synergies can arise from economies of scale, increased market power, or the sharing of resources and capabilities.</li> <li>Valuation: The price paid for the target company is another key factor that can influence the success of an M&amp;A transaction. If the acquiring company overpays for the target, it may be difficult to realize sufficient value from the transaction to justify the price.</li> <li>Integration: The integration of the two companies after the transaction is completed is another critical factor. This involves combining operations, systems, and processes, as well as managing cultural differences and addressing any employee concerns.</li> <li> <p>External factors: External factors such as market conditions, regulatory environment, and economic trends can also influence the success or failure of an M&amp;A transaction. For example, a downturn in the economy or increased regulatory scrutiny could make it more difficult to realize value from the transaction. --&gt; Factors influencing cross-border M&amp;A decisions can vary depending on the specific deal and the companies involved. However, here are some of the most common factors that can influence cross-border M&amp;A decisions:</p> </li> <li> <p>Market access: A company may be motivated to acquire a company in another country in order to gain access to new markets and customers.</p> </li> <li>Synergies: A company may be motivated to acquire a company in another country in order to achieve synergies, such as cost savings, revenue growth, or increased efficiency.</li> <li>Diversification: A company may be motivated to acquire a company in another country in order to diversify their product base or gain access to new markets.        </li> <li>Economies of scale: A company may be motivated to acquire a company in another country in order to achieve economies of scale, which can help them reduce costs and increase efficiency.        </li> <li>Access to unique assets/technology: A company may be motivated to acquire a company in another country in order to gain access to unique assets that cannot be obtained through other methods.</li> <li>Regulatory environment: The regulatory environment in a foreign country can also be a factor in cross-border M&amp;A decisions. For example, a company may be more likely to pursue a cross-border acquisition if the regulatory environment in the target country is favorable to foreign investment.</li> </ul> <p>Question</p> <p>What is the life cycle of a company in relation to M&amp;A?</p> Answer <p>At the beginning of a company's life cycle, it is private and financed mostly with seed capital and venture capital through private placement. Then, with an initial public offering (IPO), the company becomes public. Once the company is public, it can engage in M&amp;A activities such as mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, leveraged buyouts (LBOs), follow-on equity offerings, and stock buybacks.</p>"}, {"location": "courses/macr/exam/#ma-process-sell-side-and-buy-side-activities_1", "title": "M&amp;A Process: sell-side and buy-side activities", "text": "<p>Question</p> <p>Describe the main phases in a sell-side M&amp;A process. As financial advisor or investment banker, which activities would you indicate to your client (the seller) as the most important and delicate in the sale process, if the selected potential buyer is a strategic investors?</p> Answer <p>A sell-side M&amp;A process typically involves several phases:</p> <p>&lt;!--   1. Preparation: In this phase, the seller and their financial advisor or investment banker prepare for the sale by gathering and organizing information about the company, including its financials, operations, and market position. They may also develop marketing materials and identify potential buyers. 2. Marketing: In this phase, the seller and their financial advisor or investment banker reach out to potential buyers to gauge their interest in acquiring the company. This may involve sending out teasers and confidential information memorandums (CIMs) to potential buyers and answering any questions they may have. 3. Due Diligence: Once a potential buyer has expressed interest in acquiring the company, they will typically conduct due diligence to verify the information provided by the seller and assess the risks and opportunities associated with the acquisition. This may involve reviewing the company's financials, operations, legal and regulatory compliance, and other relevant information. 4. Negotiation: After due diligence is completed, the buyer and seller will enter into negotiations to determine the terms of the acquisition, including the purchase price and any conditions or contingencies. This may involve several rounds of back-and-forth discussions until both parties reach an agreement. 5. Closing: Once an agreement has been reached, the buyer and seller will finalize the transaction by signing a definitive agreement and transferring ownership of the company to the buyer.</p> <p>As a financial advisor or investment banker representing the seller in a sell-side M&amp;A process where the selected potential buyer is a strategic investor, some of the most important and delicate activities in the sale process would include:</p> <ul> <li>Identifying potential strategic buyers: It's important to identify potential strategic buyers who may be interested in acquiring the company and who can offer synergies that can enhance its value.</li> <li>Preparing marketing materials: The marketing materials should highlight the strategic value of the company to potential strategic buyers and emphasize any synergies that can be realized through an acquisition.</li> <li>Managing due diligence: Due diligence can be a complex and time-consuming process, so it's important to manage it effectively to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the buyer in a timely manner.</li> <li>Negotiating favorable terms: Negotiating favorable terms for the seller is crucial in any M&amp;A transaction.

The seller may also engage a financial advisor or investment banker to help with the sale process.        </li> <li>Packaging and Marketing: the seller creates marketing materials and reaches out to potential buyers. This may involve creating a teaser or executive summary, preparing a confidential information memorandum (CIM), and identifying potential buyers through research and outreach. Buyers Scouting and Screening: a list of potential buyers is defined and prospective buyers are approached. Then according to company-specific screening criteria, the remaining buyers receive the Information Memorandum and sign the NDA. </li> <li>LOI and DD: top prospective buyers are invited to the data room in order to disclose legal and financial documents of the target to perform the DD, following which they will be invited to submit a bid or a letter of intent.</li> <li>Final negotiations and closing: After selecting the final buyer, the final offer will be presented and the drafting of the purchase agreement starts.

In a strategic alliance, you get only what you need (certain know-how or distribution channels). If you have to buy a company only for a strategic asset, it can be very costly.</li> <li>Disadvantages: a partnering arrangement is more complicated in terms of governance and we need to be very specific in terms of responsibilities.

The potential partners believed that significant operating synergies could be created by combining the two businesses resulting in a marked improvement in operating performance. How should the ownership distribution of the JV be determined?</p> Answer <p>Let\u2019s assume that the measure is EBITDA, because both have positive revenues but they are losing money. How do they negotiate their shares in the alliance? We can evaluate what will be the effect on the business and on sales if the firm owns all the assets (its assets + partner\u2019s assets). We need to measure also the financial needs and know-how and the impact on cost-structure if joining the JV.

A strategic buyer is a corporation that operates in the same or an adjacent market as the target company and seeks to create synergies with their existing business. They are interested in how the acquired firm aligns with their long-term business plans and may be willing to pay a premium for companies that fit well into their existing operations.</p> <p>On the other hand, a financial buyer views the acquisition as an investment and aims to grow the company and resell it at a higher value. They are interested in making an investment in a company and realizing considerable returns from it. Typical financial buyers are Private Equity Firms that use leverage to try and realize large financial returns.</p> <p>In terms of transaction efficiency, strategic buyers may have an advantage because they may already have the expertise to continue the business\u2019 operations. In contrast, a financial buyer may have the money they need to acquire a given firm, but may not have the necessary knowledge or expertise to successfully operate it.

Bonds, on the other hand, are debt securities that promise to repay principal with interest to bondholders.</p> <p>Some of the key differences between stocks and bonds include their risk profiles, potential returns, and rights associated with ownership. Stocks are generally considered to be riskier than bonds because their value can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions and company performance.

Bondholders have a fixed claim on a company's assets and income through interest payments but do not participate in its profits beyond this fixed return.</p> <p>Another key difference between stocks and bonds is the rights associated with ownership.

The foundation was laid by the \"big bang\" reform of the German postal system in 1990, the law concerning the Structure of Posts and Telecommunications Retained Deutsche. Deutsche Post was a state-owned company, but aimed to prepare the company for gradual privatization (the firm went public In 2000 with an initial sale of 20 percent of share capital). In the following years, the company went through a period of consolidation and restructuring which saw the integration of the former East German Post. By 1997, a year which saw a liberalization of the German postal market, the company had put into place the groundwork for a period of rapid international expansion. The subsequent globalization of Deutsche Post's activities was largely given by the demands of a growing number of business customers for a single provider of integrated national and international shipping and logistics services.</p> <p>Over the next five years Deutsche Post responded by acquiring key players in the international transport and logistics market, notably Danzas and DHL, with the aim of becoming the leading global provider of express and logistics services. This international expansion enabled Deutsche Post, renamed Deutsche Post World Net (DPWN) in order to highlight its global ambitions, to gain a major contract with the fellow German company BMW for the transport, storage and delivery of cars to its Asian dealerships. As part of a so-called \"START\" programme, DPWN initiated in 2003 a programme aimed at harmonizing products and sales structures, creating integrated networks and implementing group-wide process management in order to realize the benefits of the economies of scale resulting from its global operations. At the same time DPWN implemented the \"One brand, One face of the customers\" motto by making the DHL brand its global public face, with the expectation that this \"familiar and trusted brand name will aid us as we continue to develop globalized services\". Deregulation and wider political changes, reflected in the elimination of trade restrictions, continued to curve international expansion. </p> <p>China's entry into the World Trade Organization enhanced the potential for growth in the International postal market. Accordingly, DPWN strengthened its commitment to this increasingly important market and was rewarded with a 35% growth rate over the period from 2002 to 2004 and, through a joint venture with Sinotrans, gained 40% market share of Chinese cross-border express services. DPWN aimed to exploit regulatory changes closer to home as well. With its subsidiary Deutsche Post Global Mail (UK) gaining a long-term license for unlimited bulk mail delivery from the British regulator Postcomm, DPWN saw further opportunity for growth in the UK and continued to expand its presence in the British postal market through the acquisition of the postal operator Speedmail.</p> <ol> <li>Thinking about the operations of M&amp;A that Deutsche Post did to sustain its international expansion, what kind of integration approach do you think Deutsche Post might have used?</li> <li>Discuss the reasons why in China Deutsche Post decided to enter the market through a JV.

For his small business to survive, Coulombe decided to change his strategy and supply upscale specialty products such as wine, drinks, and gourmet foods to customers. Coulombe changed the name of his stores to Trader Joe\u2019s and stocked them with every variety and brand of California wine that was then being produced. He also began to offer fine foods like bread, crackers, cheese, fruits, and vegetables to complement and encourage wine sales. His planning paid off; customers loved his new upscale supermarket concept and the premium products he chose to stock sold quickly\u2014and they were more profitable to sell. From the beginning Coulombe realized that finding a new niche in the supermarket business was only the first step to help his small, growing company succeed. He knew that to encourage customers to visit his stores and buy more expensive gourmet products he needed to provide them with excellent customer service. So, he had to find ways to motivate his salespeople to perform at a high level. His approach to organizing was to decentralize authority and empower salespeople to take responsibility for meeting customer needs. Rather than instructing employees to follow strict operating rules and to get the approval of their supervisor before making customer-specific decisions, employees were given autonomy to make their own decisions and provide personalized customer service. Coulombe\u2019s approach led employees to feel they \u201cowned\u201d their supermarkets, and he worked to develop a culture based on values and norms about providing excellent customer service and developing personalized relationships with customers, who are often on first-name terms. Coulombe led by example and created a store environment in which employees were treated as individuals and felt valued as people. For example, the theme behind the design of his stores was to create the feeling of a Hawaiian resort: employees wear loud Hawaiian shirts, store managers are called captains, and the store d\u00e9cor uses lots of wood and contains tiki huts, where employees provide customers with food and drink samples and interact with them. Once again, this helped to create strong values and norms that emphasize personalized customer service. Finally, Joe Coulombe\u2019s approach was strongly influenced by the way he went about controlling salespeople. From the outset he created a policy of promotion from within the company so that the highest-performing salespeople could rise to become store captains and beyond in the organization. And, from the beginning, he recognized the need to treat employees in a fair and equitable way to encourage them to develop the customer-oriented values and norms needed to provide personalized customer service. He decided that full-time employees should earn at least the median household income for their communities, which averaged $7,000 a year in the 1960s and is $48,000 today\u2014an astonishingly high amount compared to the pay of employees of regular supermarkets such as Kroger\u2019s and Safeway. Moreover, store captains, who are vital in helping create and reinforce Trader Joe\u2019s store culture, are rewarded with salaries and bonuses that can exceed $100,000 a year. And all salespeople know that as the store chain expands they may also be promoted to this level.

The meatpacking plant, which regularly passed inspections by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), employed over 200 workers who slaughtered and then prepared the beef for shipment to fast-food restaurants such as Burger King and Taco Bell. Most of the millions of pounds of meat the plant prepared yearly, however, were delivered under contract to one of the federal government\u2019s most coveted accounts: the National School Lunch Program, which named the plant supplier of the year in 2005.42 So at the end of 2007 when the Humane Society turned over a videotape, secretly filmed by one of its investigators who had taken a job as a plant employee, to the San Bernardino County district attorney that showed major violations of safety procedures, it caused an uproar. The videotape showed two workers dragging sick cows up the ramp that led to the slaughterhouse using metal chains and forklifts, shocking them with electric prods, and shooting streams of water in their noses and faces. Not only did the tape show inhumane treatment of animals, it also provided evidence that the company was flaunting the ban on allowing sick animals to enter the food supply chain, something that federal regulations explicitly outlawed for fear of human health and disease issues. By 2008, the USDA, concerned that contaminated beef had entered the supply chain, especially the one leading to the nation\u2019s schools, issued a notice for the recall of 143 million pounds of beef processed in the plant over the last two years, the largest recall in history. In addition, the plant was shut down as the investigation proceeded. In 2008, when CEO Steven Mendell was subpoenaed to appear before the House Panel Energy and Commerce Committee, he denied these violations had taken place and that any diseased cows had entered the food chain.When panel members demanded that he view the videotape, he claimed he had not seen it, even though it was widely available, and he was forced to acknowledge that \u201ctwo cows\u201d had in fact entered the plant and that inhumane treatment of animals had taken place.43 Moreover, federal investigators turned up evidence that as early as 1996 the plant has been cited for overuse of electric prods to speed cattle through the plant and had been cited for other violations since, suggesting these abuses had been going on for a long period. This view gained strength when one of the workers shown in the videotape claimed that supervisors were pressuring workers to ensure 500 cows a day were slaughtered and processed so the plant could meet its quota and make the high profits the meatpacking business provides\u2014and that he and other workers had no say in the matter: They were just \u201cfollowing orders from the supervisor.\u201d These unethical and illegal work practices led investigators to fear that over the years, thousands of sick cows had been allowed to enter the food chain. Most of the 143 million pounds of beef recalled had already been consumed anyway. Not only customers, and especially schoolchildren, have been harmed by the company\u2019s illegal actions, however. It seems likely that the plant will be permanently shut down and all 220 workers will lose their jobs. Indeed, the employees directly implicated by the video have already been prosecuted and one, who pleaded guilty to animal abuse, was convicted and sentenced to six months of imprisonment in 2008. 44 Whether or not the company\u2019s managers will experience the same fate remains to be seen, but clearly all stakeholders have been hurt by the unethical, inhumane, and illegal actions by managers that, as the Humane Society had suspected for years, were commonplace in the plant.

In 2011 IKEA sales soared to over $35 billion, or over 20% of the global furniture market; but to its managers and employees this was just the tip of the iceberg. They believed IKEA was poised for massive growth throughout the world in the coming decade because it could provide what the average customer wanted: well-designed and well-made contemporary furniture at an affordable price. IKEA\u2019s ability to provide customers with affordable furniture is the result of the way it expands globally and operates its global store empire. In a nutshell, IKEA\u2019s global approach focuses on simplicity, attention to detail, cost consciousness, and responsiveness in every aspect of its operations and behavior. IKEA\u2019s global approach derives from the personal values and beliefs of its founder, Ingvar Kamprad, about how companies should treat their employees and customers. Kamprad, who is in his early 80s (and in 2010 ranked as the 11th-richest person in the world), was born in Smaland, a poor Swedish province whose citizens are known for being entrepreneurial, frugal, and hardworking. Kamprad definitely absorbed these values\u2014when he entered the furniture business, he made them the core of his management approach. He teaches store managers and employees his values; his beliefs about the need to operate in a no-frills, cost-conscious way; and his view that they are all in business \u201ctogether,\u201d by which he means that every person who works in his global empire plays an essential role and has an obligation to everyone else. What does Kamprad\u2019s approach mean in practice? All IKEA employees fly coach class on business trips, stay in inexpensive hotels, and keep traveling expenses to a minimum. And IKEA stores operate on the simplest rules and procedures possible, with employees expected to cooperate to solve problems and get the job done. Many famous stories circulate about the frugal Kamprad, such as that even he always flies coach class and that when he takes a soda can from the minibar in a hotel room, he replaces it with one bought in a store\u2014despite the fact that he is a multibillionaire. IKEA\u2019s employees see what Kamprad\u2019s global approach means as soon as they are recruited to work in a store in one of the many countries in which the company operates. They start learning about IKEA\u2019s global corporate culture by performing jobs at the bottom of the ladder, and they are quickly trained to perform all the various jobs involved in store operations. During this process they internalize IKEA\u2019s global values and norms, which center on the importance the company attaches to their taking the initiative and responsibility for solving problems and for focusing on customers. Employees are rotated between departments and sometimes stores, and rapid promotion is possible for those who demonstrate the enthusiasm and togetherness that show they have bought into IKEA\u2019s global culture. Most of IKEA\u2019s top managers rose from its ranks, and the company holds \u201cbreaking the bureaucracy weeks\u201d in which managers are required to work in stores and warehouses for a week each year to make sure they and all employees stay committed to IKEA\u2019s global values. No matter which country they operate in, all employees wear informal clothes to work at IKEA\u2014Kamprad has always worn an open-neck shirt\u2014and there are no marks of status such as executive dining rooms or private parking places. Employees believe that if they buy into IKEA\u2019s work values, behave in ways that keep its growing global operations streamlined and efficient, and focus on being one step ahead of potential problems, they will share in its success. Promotion, training, above-average pay, a generous store bonus system, and the personal well-being that comes from working in a company where people feel valued are some of the rewards that Kamprad pioneered to build and strengthen IKEA\u2019s global approach. Whenever IKEA enters a new country, it sends its most experienced store managers to establish its global approach in its new stores. When IKEA first entered the United States, the attitude of U.S. employees puzzled its managers. Despite their obvious drive to succeed and good education, employees seemed reluctant to take initiative and assume responsibility. IKEA\u2019s managers discovered that their U.S. employees were afraid mistakes would result in the loss of their jobs, so the managers strove to teach employees the \u201cIKEA way.\u201d The approach paid off: The United States has become the company\u2019s second best country market, and IKEA plans to open many more U.S. stores, as well as stores around the world, over the next decade.</p> <ol> <li>List the various ways in which IKEA has managed the global environment over time.</li> <li>How would you explain the rationale behind the success of IKEA\u2019s approach to managing its environment?</li> </ol> Answer <p>TODO</p>"}, {"location": "courses/odb/exam/#organizational-design", "title": "Organizational design", "text": ""}, {"location": "courses/odb/exam/#basic-challenges-of-organizational-design", "title": "Basic challenges of organizational design", "text": "<p>Case</p> Sony\u2019s \u201cGaijin\u201d CEO is Reorganizing the company <p>Sony, the famous Japanese electronics maker, was renowned in the 1990s for using its engineering prowess to develop blockbuster new products such as the Walkman, Trinitron TV, and PlayStation. Its engineers churned out an average of four new product ideas every day, something attributed to its culture, called the \u201cSony Way,\u201d which emphasized communication, cooperation, and harmony among its company-wide product engineering teams.36 Sony\u2019s engineers were empowered to pursue their own ideas, and the leaders of its different divisions, and hundreds of product teams were allowed to pursue their own innovations\u2014no matter what the cost. While this approach to leadership worked so long as Sony could churn out blockbuster products, it did not work in the 2000s as agile global competitors from Taiwan, Korea, and the United States innovated new technologies and products that began to beat Sony at its own game. Companies such as LG, Samsung, and Apple innovated new technologies such as advanced LCD flat-screens, flash memory, touch-screen commands, mobile digital music, video, and GPS positioning devices, and 3D displays that made many of Sony\u2019s technologies, such as its Trinitron TVs and Walkmans obsolete. For example, products such as Apple\u2019s iPod and iPhone and Nintendo\u2019s Wii game console better met customer needs than Sony\u2019s out-of-date and expensive products. Why did Sony lose its leading competitive position? One reason was that Sony\u2019s organizing approach no longer worked in its favor because the leaders of its different product divisions worked to protect their own personal empires and divisions\u2019 goals and not those of the whole company. Sony\u2019s leaders were slow to recognize the speed at which technology was changing and as each division\u2019s performance fell, their leaders felt threatened and competition between them increased as they sought to protect their own empires. The result was slower decision making and increased operating costs as the leaders of each division competed to obtain the funding necessary to develop successful new products. By 2005 Sony was in big trouble; and at this crucial point in their company\u2019s history, Sony\u2019s top managers turned to a gaijin, or non-Japanese, executive to lead their company. Their choice was Sir Howard Stringer, a Welshman, who as the head of Sony\u2019s U.S. operations had been instrumental in cutting costs and increasing profits. Stringer\u2019s was known to be a directive but participative leader; although he was closely involved in all U.S. top management decisions he nevertheless then gave his top executives the authority to develop successful strategies to implement these decisions. </p> <p>When he became Sony\u2019s CEO in 2005 Stringer faced the immediate problem of reducing operating costs that were double those of its competitors because the leaders of its divisions had essentially seized control of Sony\u2019s top-level decision-making authority. Stringer immediately recognized how the extensive power struggles among the leaders of Sony\u2019s different product divisions were hurting the company. So, adopting a directive, command-and-control leadership approach, he made it clear that this had to stop and that they needed to work quickly to reduce costs\u2014but he also urged them to cooperate to speed product development across divisions. By 2007 it was clear that many of Sony\u2019s most important divisional leaders were still pursuing their own goals and were ignoring Stringer\u2019s orders. By 2008 Stringer had replaced all the divisional leaders who resisted his orders, and he worked steadily to downsize Sony\u2019s bloated corporate headquarters staff and replace the leaders of functions who also put their own interests first. He promoted younger managers to lead its divisions and functions\u2014managers who would obey his orders and focus on the company\u2019s performance because as Stringer said over time the culture or business of Sony had been management\u2014not making new products. To turn around Sony\u2019s still declining performance, Stringer had to adopt an even more directive approach. In 2009 Stringer announced he would take charge of the Japanese company\u2019s struggling core electronics group and would add the title of president to his existing roles as chairman and CEO as he reorganized Sony\u2019s divisions. He also replaced four more of its most important leaders with managers who had held positions outside Japan and were \u201cfamiliar with the digital world.\u201d In the future, he also told managers to prioritize new products and invest only in those with the greatest chance of success so Sony could reduce its out-of-control R&amp;D costs. By 2010 Sony\u2019s financial results suggested that Stringer\u2019s initiatives were finally paying off; he had stemmed Sony\u2019s huge losses, its products were selling better, and Stringer hoped Sony would become profitable by the end of 2011.To help ensure this Stringer also took charge of a newly created networked products and services group that included its Vaio computers, Walkman digital media players, PlayStation gaming console, and the software and online services to support these products. Stringer\u2019s organizing approach was still focused on helping Sony regain its global leadership in electronic products.37 In January 2011 Stringer announced that Sony\u2019s performance had increased so much that it would be profitable in the second half of 2011. Then within months came the news that hackers had invaded Sony\u2019s Playstation website and stolen the private information of millions of its users. Sony was forced to shut down its Playstation website for weeks and compensate users, and together it expects the losses from this debacle to exceed $1 billion as well as the cost to its brand name. In addition, it also became clear that customers were not buying its expensive new 3D flatscreen TVs and that its revenues from consumer products would be lower than expected because of intense competition from companies like Samsung. In June 2011 Stringer reported that now the company expected to make a record loss in 2011, so his turnaround efforts have been foiled so far.</p> <ol> <li>What pressures and forces from the environment led Stringer to change the balance between centralizing and decentralizing authority at Sony?</li> <li>How would you describe Stringer\u2019s approach to organizing?

It now consists of Royal Mail itself, which concentrates on the letter and small packet business by utilizing 60 mail centers, 8 regional distribution centers, and 1,400 local delivery offices. Post Office Counters is also part of the Royal Mail Group and still boasts a network of 12,000 branches throughout the UK. Parcelforce Worldwide, the group\u2019s parcel brand, is still a significant player in a highly competitive sector, and General Logistics Systems is Royal Mail\u2019s European parcel company. The organization has not, however, always been in this form. As a nationalized business and later as a PLC wholly owned by the government, Royal Mail has had to contend with a succession of differing government reviews and policies and the loss of its prized letter delivery monopoly in 2006. An additional problem has been Royal Mail\u2019s industrial relations record, which, over the years, could be described as difficult to say the least. The Internet also posed highly significant challenges to the business. A sharp reduction in social mail accompanied the rise of email, although the greeting card business has held up well. The Internet did however provide an opportunity for Royal Mail and Parcelforce to deliver a growing number of items sent out by Internet retailers such as Amazon. Post Office Counters has faced structural decline of a different type. It has also been hit by a decline in demand for letter post services, but more significantly it has ceded much of its role as an agent for paying pensions and child benefits as successive governments have tried to persuade customers to receive these payments through an electronic transfer system that is far less expensive to administer.Vehicle Licensing can now also be performed online. However, because of its heritage and presence in even the most remote parts of the country, it has been seen as a community service as well as a profit making enterprise. Consequently, politicians have often argued a case for keeping Post Offices in remote villages even if Post Office regional management have felt that it was not viable to do so. Understandably, managing a group of this size has posed some major challenges in terms of designing organizational structures. BT was, in fact, originally part of the Post Office under the name Post Office Telecommunications and gained their own identity only in 1981. Subsequently, Royal Mail operated as a highly bureaucratic organization encompassing letter and parcel delivery and Post Office counter functions. There was a low degree of specialization and a high degree of multi-skilling in some parts of the organization, for example, administrative staff could expect to serve on the counter and also work in the back office functions of Royal Mail. Sorting Office staff could also be trained on a variety of roles concerning sorting, distribution, and delivery of mail. A set of Post Office rules was available in several large volumes to consult in the case of almost any eventuality. In addition, there was a Postmaster/Postmistress in every city who took overall responsibility for the operation of the services within his or her district. In 1986, a decision was taken to separate the organization into Royal Mail Letters, Royal Mail Parcels, and Post Office Counters, which itself became a limited company in 1987. However, the organization did retain a group board to coordinate overall strategy, and each separate business gained its own managing director. Staff working in a particular business when the split was announced largely stayed there. A significant reorganization was implemented in the early 1990\u2019s, when the Royal Mail introduced the \u201cBusiness Development\u201d initiative. The business was reorganized into nine divisions, instead of the 64 previous Postmaster/ Postmistress districts. These divisions were given responsibility for their own budgetary performance and effectively possessed a great degree of autonomy. Layers of management were removed, thus considerably reducing the number of levels between frontline staff and board level in a move that was also designed to promote empowerment amongst the workforce. An emphasis on rulebooks was now replaced by an expectation of initiative. A further split was then implemented on the operational part of Royal Mail where delivering, sorting, and distribution functions were separated. Meanwhile, the newly devolved Post Office Counters Ltd followed a different course. Many small Post Offices were already being run on a basis that involved the SubPostmaster or Sub-Postmistress buying a Post Office premises on the open market. They then receive a salary commensurate with the size of the business and can employ their own staff if required. They often also run a convenience store within the same premises. At the time of the split, larger offices were staffed by workers directly employed by the Post Office, mostly on a full time basis. In recent years, increasingly larger offices have been bought by Sub-Postmasters and Sub-Postmistresses and staffed by their own employees, many of whom are employed on a part-time basis. This trend has continued, and the number of directly managed offices has fallen from 1,500 in 1988 to 373 in 2011. The current coalition government have bold plans for the Royal Mail Group.

By 2006, it had grown to 36 different brands, but although revenues had soared from $2 billion to over $5 billion, its profits had not kept pace. In fact, profits were falling because costs were rising as operational efficiency fell due to the enormous complexity and expense involved in managing so many brands.25 So Liz Claiborne recruited a new CEO, William McComb, to find a way to turn around the troubled company. Within months he decided to reverse course, shrink the company, and move to a new form of organizational structure that would once again allow it to grow\u2014but this time with increasing profitability.

For example, luxury designer lines like Ellen Tracy were grouped into one division; clothes for working women such as its signature Liz Claiborne and Dana Buchman brands were in a second; trendy, hip clothing directed at young customers such as its Juicy Couture line were in a third division, and so on. A separate management team controlled each division, and each division performed all the functional activities like marketing and design needed to support its brands. The problem was that over time it had become increasingly difficult both to differentiate between apparel brands in each division as well as between the brands of different divisions because fashion styles change quickly in response to the demands of changing customer tastes. Also, costs were rising because of the duplication of activities between divisions, and increasing industry competition was resulting in new pressure to lower prices to retail stores to protect sales. McComb decided it was necessary to streamline and change Liz Claiborne\u2019s organizational structure to meet the changing needs of customers and the increasing competition in retailing because of the growth of private-label brands. First, he decided that the company would either try to sell, license, or if necessary close down 16 of its 36 brands and focus on the remaining 20 that had the best chance of generating good profits in the future.26 To better manage these 20 brands, he decided to change its organizational structure and to shrink from five different divisions to just two. This eliminated an entire level of top management, but it also allowed him to eliminate the duplication in marketing, distribution, and retail functions across the old five divisions and so would result in major cost savings. The two remaining divisions are now its retail division called \u201cdirect brands\u201d and its wholesale division called \u201cpartnered brands.\u201d Its new structure is intended to \u201cbring focus, energy and clarity\u201d to the way each division operates. The retail division, for example, is responsible for the brands that are sold primarily through Liz Claiborne\u2019s own retail store chains, such as its Kate Spade, Lucky Brand Jeans, and Juicy Couture chains. The goals of grouping together its fastest-growing brands is to allow divisional managers to make better marketing and distribution decisions to attract more customers. For example, Liz Claiborne plans to increase targeted marketing on direct labels to 3% to 5% of annual sales and to find ways to get new clothing designs more quickly to its store to compete with chains like Zara that are able to innovate new clothing collections almost every month. The company also plans to open 300 more stores in the next few years to add to its 433 specialty stores and 350 outlets stores. In contrast, the problem in the wholesale division, which sells branded apparel lines such as Liz Claiborne and Dana Buchman directly to department stores and other retailers, is to reduce costs to slow down the growing threat from private labels. For example, sales of Macy\u2019s private labels increased almost 10% during the 2000s. If managers of the wholesale division can find ways to improve operating efficiency, it can offer stores like Macy\u2019s lower prices for its clothing to encourage them to stick with its brands. Similarly, if the division\u2019s managers can find ways to reduce costs such as by turning inventory over more quickly, sharing marketing costs, and so forth, then even if the prices they can charge do fall, they can still increase profits. Wholesale managers are also partnering with department stores to develop exclusive lines of branded clothing so both parties benefit. For example, they reached an agreement with JCPenney to launch a line called Liz &amp; Co. that will be sold only in its stores; so far sales have been good, and both partners have enjoyed higher profits. Thus CEO McComb realized that to reduce complexity and allow each division to build the right merchandising culture, it was necessary to change Liz Claiborne\u2019s organizational structure. From grouping clothing products into divisions based on their quality or price, he changed to two market divisions where clothing brands are grouped according to the needs of each division\u2019s customers\u2014either the people in its stores or the retail chains that buy its clothes to resell to individual customers. The real problem is that each division faces a quite different set of strategic and operational problems, and with its new structure managers in each division can now focus on solving the specific set of problems to achieve the best performance from their particular brands. In 2010, McComb\u2019s hope is that in the next decade the company\u2019s sales will grow rapidly, but this time its new structure will lead to higher efficiency and effectiveness and so rising profitability.</p> <ol> <li>What were the problems with Liz Claiborne\u2019s old organizational structure?</li> <li>How did McComb change Liz Claiborne\u2019s structure to improve its effectiveness?

Southwest managers and employees alike are committed to the success of the organization and do all they can to help one another and to provide customers with excellent service (a terminal value). Four times a year, Southwest managers work as baggage handlers, ticket agents, and flight attendants so they get a feel for the problems facing other employees. An informal norm makes it possible for employees to gather with Kelleher every Friday at noon in the company\u2019s Dallas parking lot for a company cookout. Southwest keeps the organization as flat and informal as possible, and managers encourage employees to be creative and to develop rules and norms to solve their own problems. To please customers, for example, employees dress up on special days like Halloween and Valentine\u2019s Day and wear \u201cfun uniforms\u201d every Friday. In addition, they try to develop innovative ways to improve customer service and satisfaction. All employees participate in a bonus system that bases rewards on company performance, and employees own over 22% of the airline\u2019s stock. The entrance hall at company headquarters at Love Field in Dallas is full of plaques earned by employees for their outstanding performance. Everybody in the organization cooperates to achieve Southwest\u2019s goal of providing low-cost, high-quality service. The culture of excellence that Southwest has created seems to be working to its advantage. Southwest increased its operating routes and profits every year and is the most profitable airline flying today. Contrast Southwest\u2019s CEO and culture with that of Value Line, Inc. Jean Buttner, publisher of the Value Line Investment Survey, fashioned a culture that the company\u2019s employees apparently hated. In her attempt to reduce costs and improve efficiency, she created instrumental values of frugality and economy that poisoned employees\u2019 attitudes toward the organization. Employees were told to sign in by 9 A. M. every day and sign out when leaving. If they faked their arrival or departure time, they could be terminated. Because at Value Line messy desks were regarded as signs of laziness or \u201cunproductivity,\u201d Buttner required department managers to file a \u201cclean surfaces report\u201d every day, certifying that employees did tidy up their desks.51 Salary increases were also kept as small as possible and the company\u2019s bonus and health plans were under tight rein. How have these values paid off? Many highly trained professional workers left Value Line because of the hostile atmosphere produced by these \u201ceconomical\u201d values and by work rules that devalued employees. Also, this turnover generated discontent among the company\u2019s customers, who began to complain. So bad did feelings between employees and Buttner become that employees reportedly put up a notice on their bulletin board that criticized Buttner\u2019s management CHAPTER 7 \u2022 CREATING AND MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE  227 style and suggested that the company could use some new leadership.

In 2003, Schering was under pressures from many fronts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was demanding a complete overhaul of its global manufacturing plants to increase and protect drug quality, and the patent on Claritin, its best-selling drug, was running out and it had few new products in the pipeline. Thus on both the quality and innovation dimensions, major sources of a differentiation advantage, the company\u2019s strategy was in trouble. Schering-Plough\u2019s board of directors recruited Fred Hassan, a Pakistan-born Harvard MBA, to turn the company around. After meeting with hundreds of groups of managers and scientists, and visiting the company\u2019s operations around the globe, Hassan began to realize that the company\u2019s main problems stemmed from its global strategy and structure.49 Over time, the company had developed a multidomestic approach to planning its global value-chain activities and it had divided its activities up into world regions, where essentially each world region acted as the product group that made decisions inside its world region/group. The problem was that each of the heads of the regional groups had gained a near total control of their operations, so each world region was doing things such as manufacturing and marketing and sales in its own unique way. As a result, managers at corporate headquarters, and especially its top-management team, were not getting accurate information about the way each region, and especially the country operations within each region, were performing. And major drug quality problems had arisen because the corporate center didn\u2019t find out about the problems at the country level until a long time after they had occurred because of all the bureaucracy that had emerged at the level of the regional groups. Schering only makes one major type of product\u2014 drugs\u2014so Hassan decided it did not need separate worldwide product groups or separate regional groups. He decided to slash the number of levels in the company\u2019s global corporate hierarchy, eliminating all the layers between the country managers and himself. The heads of each international division now report directly to him or one of his top-management team members, so it is much easier to observe and evaluate their performance\u2014and that of their divisions. It is also easier to standardize issues such as quality and sales practices around the world. He has also worked to expand the range of products each international division sells to achieve economies of scale. In 2007, for example, Hassan engaged in related diversification when he bought a major Dutch pharmaceutical company that is a leader in producing vaccines for animals and pets, as well as possessing a pipeline of potentially bestselling new drugs\u2014it has five drugs in late trials, including an important new treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. His new global organizational structure worked so well and sales and profits increased so much that by 2010 it was bought by and became part of Merck, one of its major competitors. Hassan is now the chairman of Bausch &amp; Lomb, an optical products company, where he is applying the same kinds of organizational structure changes to help increase that company\u2019s global competitive position.</p> <ol> <li>What kinds of problems was Schering-Plough experiencing with its global strategy and structure?</li> <li>How did Schering Plough change its global structure to solve these problems?</li> </ol> Answer <p>TODO</p>"}, {"location": "courses/odb/exam/#organizational-change", "title": "Organizational change", "text": ""}, {"location": "courses/odb/exam/#types-and-forms-of-organizational-change", "title": "Types and forms of organizational change", "text": "<p>Case</p> Nike Learns How to Change <p>Nike, headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon, is the biggest sports shoemaker in the world. Throughout the 1990s it seemed that its founder and CEO, Phil Knight, and his teams of shoe designers could do no wrong; all their innovative design decisions led to the global acceptance of Nike\u2019s shoes and record sales and profits for the company. As time went by, however, and its fortune soared, some strange dynamics occurred. The company\u2019s managers and designers became convinced they \u201cknew best\u201d what customers wanted, and that their decisions about how to change and improve Nike\u2019s future shoes would be enthusiastically received by customers. But things were changing in the sport-shoe environment. New competitors had entered the market and they began to offer alternative kinds of sports shoes\u2014shoes targeted at specific market segments like skateboarders, soccer players, or power walkers. Nike had no shoes in these market segments. Moreover, Nike also failed to notice that sports shoes were evolving into performance shoes for more everyday uses such as walking or backpacking. It also failed to take note of consumers\u2019 increasing preferences for dark blue and black shoes that wore well in cities and that could double as work and walking shoes. In the 2000s Nike\u2019s sales and profits fell sharply as many of its new lines of sports shoes were not well received by customers, and CEO Phil Knight knew he had to find a way to turn his company around. Realizing that his designers were starting to make poor decisions, he brought in managers from outside the company to change the way decisions were made. An executive who was brought in to lead the outdoor products division advised Knight to take over and purchase small specialized companies, such as North Face, to quickly widen Nike\u2019s product line. But Nike\u2019s other managers and designers resisted this idea, believing that they could still make the best decisions. With sales still slumping, it became obvious that Nike would have to take over specialist shoe companies to grow successfully. One of the first of its acquisitions was Cole Haan, the luxury shoemaker, and Nike\u2019s designers proceeded to revitalize its line of shoes by using their skills to make them more comfortable. Then, realizing it had to get into small markets, in the 2000s, Nike bought other small companies such as Hurley, the skate and surfboard apparel maker. To try to overcome its past errors in its decision making, however, Knight decided on a new way to design shoes for specialized niche markets, like the skateboarding, golf, and soccer markets. Henceforth, rather than having Nike\u2019s designers all grouped together in one large design department, they would be split up into different teams. Each team would focus on developing unique products to match the needs of customers in its assigned market segment. The skate team, for example, was set up as a separate and independent unit, and its designers and marketing experts were charged to develop a unique line of shoes for the sport. Similarly, because of poor sales, Nike separated golf products from the rest of the company and created an independent unit to develop new golf shoes, clubs, and other golfing products. Nike was attempting to demolish the old companywide mindset that had resulted in its past decision-making errors that led to the wrong kinds of changes. With many different teams, each working on different lines of shoes and other products, Nike was hoping to build diversity into its decision making and create teams of experts who were attuned to changing customer needs in their segments of the sports product market. Nike\u2019s new approach to decision making worked; most of its new shoes are now leaders in their market segments and its sales and profits have soared in the 2010s as a result of the way it has changed the way it makes decisions. Nike learned from its mistakes and Knight continues to promote organizational learning\u2014the process of helping the members of an organization to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d and be willing to experiment, take risks, and make change possible.</p> <ol> <li>How did Nike change the way it made decisions and introduce new products?</li> <li>In what ways could Nike use the change techniques discussed in this chapter to find ways to improve its effectiveness and competitive advantage?</li> </ol> Answer <p>TODO</p>"}, {"location": "courses/odb/exam/#decision-making-learning-knowledge-management-and-information-technology", "title": "Decision making, learning, knowledge management, and information technology", "text": "<p>Case</p> How Mattel\u2019s Barbie Lost the War against the Bratz Doll <p>The rapid pace at which the world is changing is forcing strategic managers at all kinds of companies to speed up their decision making; otherwise they get left behind by agile competitors who respond faster to changing customer fads and fashions. Nowhere is this truer than in the global toy industry, in which vicious combat rages in the doll business, worth over $10 billion a year in sales. The largest global toy company, Mattel, has earned tens of billions of dollars from the world\u2019s best-selling doll, Barbie, since it introduced her over 50 years ago.83 Mothers who played with the original dolls bought them for their daughters, and granddaughters, and Barbie became an American icon. However, Barbie\u2019s advantage as bestselling global doll led Mattel\u2019s managers to make major strategic errors in the 2000s. Barbie and all Barbie accessories have accounted for about 50% of Mattel\u2019s toy sales since the 1990s, so protecting this star product was crucial. The Barbie doll was created in the 1960s when most women were homemakers; her voluptuous shape was a response to a dated view of what the \u201cideal\u201d woman should look like. Barbie\u2019s continuing success, however, led Mattel\u2019s CEO Bob Eckert and his top managers to underestimate how much the world had altered. Changing cultural views about the role of girls, women, sex, marriage, and women working in the last decades shifted the tastes of doll buyers. But Mattel\u2019s managers continued to bet on Barbie\u2019s eternal appeal and collectively bought into an \u201cIf it\u2019s not broken don\u2019t fix it\u201d approach. In fact, given that Barbie was the best-selling doll, they thought it might be dangerous to change her appearance; customers might not like the product development changes and stop buying the doll. Mattel\u2019s top managers decided not to rock the boat; they left the brand and business model unchanged and focused their efforts on developing new digital toys. As a result, Mattel was unprepared when a challenge came along in the form of a new kind of doll, the Bratz doll, introduced by MGA Entertainment. Many competitors to Barbie had emerged over the years because the doll business is so profitable, but no other doll had matched Barbie\u2019s appeal to young girls (or their mothers). The marketers and designers behind the Bratz line of dolls had spent a lot of time to discover what the new generation of girls, especially those aged 7\u201311, wanted from a doll, however. It turned out that the Bratz dolls they designed met the desires of these girls. Bratz dolls have larger heads and oversized eyes, wear lots of makeup and short dresses, and are multicultural to give each doll \u201cpersonality and attitude.\u201d84 The dolls were designed to appeal to a new generation of girls brought up in a fast-changing fashion, music, and television market. The Bratz dolls met the untapped needs of \u201ctween\u201d girls, and the new line took off. MGA quickly licensed the rights to make and sell the dolls to toy companies overseas, and Bratz became a serious competitor to Barbie. Mattel was in trouble. Its strategic managers had to change its business model and strategies and bring Barbie up to date; Mattel\u2019s designers must have been wishing they had been adventurous and made more radical changes earlier when they did not need to change. However, they decided to change Barbie\u2019s extreme shape; they killed off her old-time boyfriend Ken and replaced him with Blaine, an Aussie surfer.85 They also recognized they had waited much too long to introduce new lines of dolls to meet the changed needs of tweens and older girls in the 2000s. They rushed out the \u201cMy Scene\u201d and \u201cFlava\u201d lines of dolls that were obvious imitations of Bratz dolls, but they both flopped. And the decisions they made to change Barbie\u2014 her figure, looks, clothing, and boyfriends\u2014came too late, and sales of Barbie dolls continued to fall. By 2006, sales of the Barbie collection had dropped by 30%, which was critical to Mattel because its profits and stock price hinged on Barbie\u2019s success\u2014and they both plunged. Analysts argued that Mattel had not paid enough attention to its customers\u2019 changing needs or moved quickly to introduce the new and improved products necessary to keep a company on top of its market. Mattel brought back Ken, but then in a sign of its mounting problems, Mattel\u2019s lawyers sued MGA Entertainment, arguing that the Bratz dolls\u2019 copyright rightfully belonged to them. Mattel complained that the head designer of Bratz was a Mattel employee when he made the initial drawings for the dolls and that Mattel had applied for copyright protection on a number of early Bratz drawings. Mattel claimed that MGA hired key Mattel employees away from the firm and these employees stole sensitive sales information and transferred it to MGA. In 2008 a judge ruled in Mattel\u2019s favor and ordered MGA to stop using the Bratz name, and a jury awarded Mattel $100 million in damages. After an appeal, in 2009 a federal judge upheld the verdict and ruled that the Bratz doll is Mattel property and that MGA could sell the doll only until the end of 2009. In 2010 the companies were locked in a bitter dispute: Mattel wanted the rights to produce and sell the Bratz doll line, but MGA\u2019s founder was still trying to protect the profits made from the Bratz dolls\u2019 success. Meanwhile stores stopped selling the Bratz doll, Mattel revitalized its line of Barbie dolls, and its CEO exultantly declared that \u201cBarbie is back\u201d as increased doll sales helped raise the company\u2019s profits by 86% in the spring of 2010.86 Imagine then, how Mattel\u2019s managers reacted to the decision of the federal appeals court in July 2010 when it threw out the previous court decision and ruled that MGA Entertainment did have the right to make and sell the Bratz doll because their looks and image were not subject to existing copyright law!

Explain why the estimate is nearly unchanged despite the inclusion of \\(X\\) in the regression.</p> Answer <p>By including \\(X\\) in the regression, the estimated effect of \\(D\\) is nearly unchanged because \\(X\\) and \\(D\\) are uncorrelated, since the two groups are randomly selected and thus equivalent (on average) with respect to any conceivable characteristic (including \\(X\\)).</p> <p>Explain why the standard error of the estimated coefficient on \\(D\\) decreases, from 0.035 to 0.025, when \\(X\\) is added to the regression.

In this case, including it in the regression results in a smaller variance of the residuals.

They argue that patients enrolled in the study should be allowed to freely choose whether or not to get the new therapy. Comment on this proposal.</p> Answer <p>The strenght of this study relies on the perfect equivalence of the two groups, thanks to random assignment: we know for sure that the two groups differ only with respect to the therapy they received. Hence, if we find that after three months they differ with respect to their health status, there is only one possible explanation for that difference: the therapy they received.   If they were allowed to choose the therapy they prefer, it might be that the two groups would be different with respect to some confounding factors. That is, different with respect to their chance to end up in good health. Irrespective of the therapy they receive.  Hence, on observing that after three months they differ with respect to their health status, you do not really know how much it is due to the therapy and how much to something else.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Consider the following regression model:</p> \\[ Y = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1}X + \\alpha_{2}D + \\alpha_{3}XD + \\epsilon \\] <p>where \\(X\\) is a continuous variable and \\(D\\)=1 if \\(X\\)&gt;500, \\(D\\)=0 otherwise.

Here below are the reactions from participants to the table. Add your comment to each of theirs.</p> <p>\"The coefficient on \\(D\\) is negative. It means that employees do not like the new schedule.\"</p> Answer <p>The coefficient on \\(D\\) represents the difference between the two groups of firms (introducing or not the new schedule) in year 1, prior to the introduction of the new schedule. That is, that difference between the two groups cannot be attributed to the new schedule, it is due to something else. Hence, this comment is wrong</p> <p>When \\(T\\)=0 (year 1) the average difference between the two groups is the coefficient of \\(D\\). Its t-stat shows that the levels of satisfaction of the two groups are significanlty different in year 1 (\\(\\frac{-0.5}{0.2}&lt;-1.96\\)).</p> <p>\"The coefficient on T is positive, i.e. employees are more satisfied in period 2 than in period 1. It means that employees do like the new schedule.\"</p> Answer <p>The coefficient on \\(T\\) represents the variation of average satisfaction from year 1 to year 2 for the group \\(D\\)=0.  That is, this variation cannot be attributed to the introduction of the new schedule, it is due to something else.   Hence, even this comment is wrong.</p> <p>\"The coefficient on \\(DT\\) is positive, i.e. employees do like the new schedule but only in period 2, not in period 1.\"</p> Answer <p>The coefficient on \\(DT\\) represents the additional variation of average satisfaction from year 1 to year 2 for group \\(D\\)=1, on top of the variation observed on group \\(D\\)=0.  That is, the variation for group \\(D\\)=1 is as large as -0.5+0.7=0.2.  Whatever this coefficient is, it cannot be that employees do not like the new schedule in year 1, because in that year no one is under the new schedule.  Hence, even this comment is wrong.</p> <p>A second analyst uses only data from year 2 and runs a regression of \\(Y_{i,2}\\) on \\(D_{i}\\). Explain why this strategy yields a wrong estimate for the effect of the new schedule on satisfaction.</p> Answer <p>The problem of this estimate is that the two groups we compare in year 2 (\\(T\\)=1) (after the introduction of the new schedule to the group \\(D\\)=1) are different even in year 1 (\\(T\\)=0), before the introduction of the new schedule. Then, it is hardly credible that the difference we observe in year 2 is entirely due to the new schedule.</p> <p>Did the average level of satisfaction change from year 1 to year 2 for reasons other than the new schedule?</p> Answer <p>Here we focus on variation in the level of satisfaction from year 1 (\\(T\\)=0) to year 2 (\\(T\\)=1) not due to the new schedule. The only way to measure this variation is to focus on the group \\(D\\)=0, since these units are under the standard schedule in both periods. Then, if their level of satisfaction changes over the two years it cannot be due to a variation in the time schedule. Setting \\(D\\)=0 in the regression, the average variation over time is the estimated coefficient of \\(T\\), 0.4. Its t-stat shows a significant value: \\(\\frac{0.4}{0.2}&gt;1.96\\).</p> <p>Explain to the management how to estimate the effect of the new schedule using these data, clarifying the assumption implicit in your proposal.</p> Answer <p>Under the \"common trend\" assumption that in the absence of the intervention, the variation of average satisfaction from year 1 to year 2 would have been the same for the two groups, the additional variation we observe for the group \\(D\\)=1 (the coefficient of \\(DT\\)) is the so-called \"difference-in-differences\" estimate of the average causal effect of the new schedule.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Consider the regression of \\(Y\\) (natural logarithm of earnings) on \\(X_1\\) (years of schooling), \\(X_2\\) (years of labor experience) and \\(X_3\\) (gender: 1 if female, 0 if male).

The total cost function of missclassification is:</p> \\[ \\begin{split} \\text{Total cost} &amp;= \\text{Number of \"Y=1\" units} \\times \\text{Probability of \"Y=1\" misclassification} \\times \\text{Cost of \"Y=1\" misclassification} \\\\ &amp;+ \\text{Number of \"Y=0\" units} \\times \\text{Probability of \"Y=0\" misclassification} \\times \\text{Cost of \"Y=0\" misclassification} \\end{split} \\] <p>However, in this case the number of units is the same in the two categories, and the cost of missclassification is the same for the two categories. In the end, what matters is again only FPR and (1-TPR) as in the previous answer, and this leads to the same ideal number of \\(k\\).</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>The picture here below represents feature \\(Y\\) vs. feature \\(X\\) for 200 units. The analyst is searching for meaningful clusters of units within this dataset.</p> <p></p> <p>The analyst tries with k-means clustering, setting the number of clusters \\(k\\) at alternative values: \\(k\\)=2, 3, 4, 5, ... The resulting Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) as a function of \\(k\\) is summarized in the following graph.</p> <p></p> <p>Which value of \\(k\\) would you suggest? Explain.</p> Answer <p>The Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is the measure usually adopted for the degree of similarity (with respect to the feature taken into consideration: here \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)) between units belonging to the same cluster: the smaller SSE the more similar units belonging to the same cluster. Since our target is to group together in a specific cluster only similar units, we prefer a small value of SSE.</p> <p>On the other hand, we do not want to split too much. Otherwise, we are at risk to break a true cluster. To balance these two conflicting targets, the rule of thumb is to start with a low value of \\(k\\) (such as 2), and then increase it step by step and stop when increasing \\(k\\) by 1 the resulting reduction in SSE is small.  </p> <p>In the picture here above, the reduction in SSE is large increasing \\(k\\) from 2 to the 3, as well as from 3 to 4. Instead, it is much smaller increasing \\(k\\) from 4 to 5. That is, \\(k\\)=4 is a plausible solution.</p> <p>After selecting the optimal value of \\(k\\) (named \\(k^*\\)), the analyst discovers that selecting different starting values for the \\(k^*\\) centroids, the solution of k-means clustering changes.  The table here below summarizes the results produced by the k-means software.</p> Solution SSE Solution 1 4.10 Solution 2 3.90 Solution 3 4.00 Solution 4 3.95 <p>Explain to the analyst how to interpret this table to select a solution.</p> Answer <p>After setting \\(k^*\\)=4 from the previous question and having tried the k-means algorithm several times starting form different values for the centroids of the clusters, the ideal solution is the one with the smallest SSE, in this case Solution 2.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>In a classification problem the analyst has a sample of units on which he observes a score \\(X\\) and whether units belong to category A or B. The distribution of \\(X\\) in the two categories is in the figure here below (green=A, red=B). It is known that in the population 50% of units belong to category A, the remaining 50% to category B.</p> <p>To classify unlabeled units the analyst sets a threshold for the values of \\(X\\): if next unlabeled unit features a value of \\(X\\) below the threshold \\(t\\) it is classified as A, otherwise as B. The figure here below shows the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) for category B corresponding to a specific choice of the threshold.</p> <p></p> <p>The analyst argues that moving to the right the threshold \\(t\\) in the figure is a good idea because this way the TPR for category A would increase. Comment this proposal. Assume that the cost of a missclassification error is the same for the two categories.  </p> Answer <p>It is true that the TPR for category A would increase. But this is counterbalanced by a decrease in the TPR for category B. To decide, one should carefully check whether the change is worthwhile, e.g. by looking at the ROC curve.</p> <p>Now suppose that in the population the proportion of units belonging to category A is 0.1, being 0.9 for category B.  Would you move the thereshold \\(t\\) to the left or to the right? Or would you keep it as it is? Explain.</p> Answer <p>The total cost of missclassification as a function of the cutoff \\(t\\) is:</p> \\[ \\begin{split} \\text{Total cost} &amp;= N \\times 0.9 \\times (1-\\text{TPR}_{(t)}) \\times c + N \\times 0.1 \\times (\\text{FPR}_{(t)}) \\times c \\\\ &amp;= N \\times c \\times (0.9 - 0.9\\text{TPR}_{(t)} + 0.1\\text{FPR}_{(t)})\\\\ \\end{split} \\] <p>Where \\(N\\) is the number of units in the population (90% of them in B, 10% in A), \\(c\\) is the cost of missclassifying one unit (the same in the two category), \\(\\text{TPR}_{(t)}\\) and \\(\\text{FPR}_{(t)}\\) as in the text but emphasising their dependence on the cutoff \\(t\\).</p> <p>Moving \\(t\\) to the left, both \\(\\text{TPR}_{(t)}\\) and \\(\\text{FPR}_{(t)}\\) increase. But the net effect is negative, resulting in a reduction of the total cost, because the negative coefficient on \\(\\text{TPR}_{(t)}\\) (0.9) is much larger in absolute value than the positive coefficient of \\(\\text{FPR}_{(t)}\\) (0.1).</p> <p>Now suppose that the average value of \\(X\\) for category B is shifted to the right to \\(\u03bc_1\\)+10.  Would you move the threshold \\(t\\) to the right or to the left? Or would you keep it as it is? Explain.</p> Answer <p>Shifting the average \\(X\\) for category B to the right means that the current cutoff \\(t\\) ends up on the left tail of the distribution of \\(X\\) for that category. That is, the current cutoff would imply a much larger value of TPR while FPR would be the same.</p> <p>Given the shape of the two distribution we observe in the picture, it makes sense to move the cutoff to the right because this waythe reduction in the TPR would be more than counteracted by a reduction of FPR.</p> <p>Suppose the cost of missclassifying a B unit is much larger than the cost of missclassifying a A unit (10 times larger, say). With respect to the figure, would you move the threshold to the right? To the left? Or keep it as it is? Explain.</p> Answer <p>Given the evidence in the picture, it is clear that marginally moving the threshold to the left the increase in the TPR for B is approximately the same as the increase in the FPR for A. Since the cost of missclassification is much larger for B, the gain from increasing the TPR for B would be much larger than the cost of increasing the FPR for A.</p> <p>It would be then best to move the treshold to the left.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>The scatterplot here below represents a sample of units according to the values of two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). An analyst performs a k-mean cluster analysis trying with different values for the number of clusters (k). He chooses to evaluate the centroid of each cluster using the median of the two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).</p> <p></p> <p>The figure here below reports the value of SSE as a function of k (the screeplot).</p> <p></p> <p>Which value would you choose for k? Explain.</p> Answer <p>I would go with \\(k\\)=4 because the gain from moving to \\(k\\)=5 is much lower than the gain from moving from \\(k\\)=3 to \\(k\\)=4. In short, in this specific case there is an elbow at \\(k\\)=4.</p> <p>A second analyst criticizes these results arguing that the unit to the bottom right of the scatterplot is an outlier.  According to this analyst, that unit should be discarded from the sample because it bears an excessive influence on results. Do you agree this unit should be dropped? Explain.</p> Answer <p>The second analyst should resign his job immediatly. The first analyst evaluated the centroids using the median of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), not their mean. Differently from the mean, the median is unaffected by abnormal values. As a result, dropping that unit from the sample would not change the medians, hence the resulting clusters would be exactly the same.</p> <p>Now the analyst receives another piece of information on the same sample of units: labels to classify each of them into one of three possible classes (blue, red and green in the picture).</p> <p></p> <p>Keeping all the three clusters the SSE is as large as 2.5 while collapsing the green and the red cluster into a single cluster the SSE drops to 2.4. Would you go with three clusters or two clusters? Explain.</p> Answer <p>Decreasing the number of cluster the SSE cannot decrease!  </p> <p>That said, it is clear that in this case the green and the red clusters can be safely merged together.</p> <p>A new unlabeled unit comes in, it is the yellow square on the scatterplot. Think of classifying it using the \\(k\\) nearest neighbour. Does the result depend on the value of \\(k\\)? What about the unit corresponding to the yellow circle?</p> Answer <p>The yellow square looks problematic. With a small value of \\(k\\) it is likely to be included in the red or green cluster. With a larger value of \\(k\\) even the blue cluster becomes a reasonable choice. Let\u2019s say that a fair account is that the yellow square could be classified one way or the other.  </p> <p>The yellow circle instead ends up in the red/green cluster, without doubt.</p> <p>The analyst decides to use the k-nearest neighbour to classify new unlabeled units. To choose the value of \\(k\\) he splits the sample in two subgroups: a training set and a test set. Then, he classifies units in the test set using alternative values of \\(k\\) ranging from 3 to 8. The picture here below show at each value of \\(k\\) the proportion of blue units correctly classified in the blue cluster TPR and the proportion of non blue units erroneously classified in the blue cluster (FPR).  </p> <p></p> <p>Which value of \\(k\\) would you choose? Explain.</p> Answer <p>\\(k\\) here is the number of nearest neighbors taken into consideration by the classification rule, and not the number of clusters. The optimal, unfeasible solution would be a value of \\(k\\) taking us to the upper-left corner, i.e. TPR=1 and FPR=0. This is unfeasible in any practical instance, but the closer we get to it, the better. In this case the feasible solution closest to the optimal one is \\(k\\)=4, as it is clear from the picture that the red dot corresponding to \\(k\\)=4 is the one closest to the upper-left corner.</p> <p>Let the cost of missclassifying a blue unit be 100, while the cost of missclassifying a non blue unit be 50. The training set (a representative sample of the population) includes the same number of blue and non blue units. Taking into account these costs, with reference to the previous picture which \\(k\\) would you choose?</p> Answer <p>Let N be the total number of units: N/2 are blue, N/2 are not blue (say red), according to the text. The total missclassification cost is given by the number of units times their misclassification probability times the misclassification cost, for all the types of units:</p> \\[ \\begin{split} \\text{Total cost} &amp;= N_B \\times P(M_{B}) \\times C_{B} + N_R \\times P(M_{R}) \\times C_{R} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{N}{2} \\times (1-TPR) \\times 100 + \\frac{N}{2} \\times (FPR) \\times 50 \\\\ &amp;= 50N \\times (1-TPR) + 25N \\times (FPR) \\\\ &amp;= 25N \\times (2\\times(1-TPR) + FPR) \\end{split} \\] <p>The results are reported here:</p> \\(k\\) 1-TPR value FPR value Total cost 1 0.85 0.05 25N x 1.75 2 0.70 0.07 25N x 1.47 3 0.45 0.15 25N x 1.05 4 0.25 0.25 25N x 0.75 5 0.10 0.45 25N x 0.65 6 0.05 0.70 25N x 0.80 <p>The total cost is minimized at \\(k\\)=5.</p> <p>A second analyst proposes an alternative classification rule. Its Receiver Operating Curve is represented in the picture here below as the blue line.</p> <p></p> <p>To solve the classification problem which rule would you choose? The new one? Or the \\(k\\) nearest neighbour as of in the previous questions? Explain.</p> Answer <p>The blue classification rule is clearly worse than the red one. At any possible value of the FPR, the red TPR is larger than the blue one. To put it in other words, the black diagonal line in the picture is the ROC associated to the worst classification rule, i.e. classifying units by tossing a coin. The closer a ROC to the black diagonal, the worse the classification rule. In this case, it is clear that the blue ROC is closer to the black diagonal than the red ROC.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>The marketing manager of a company runs a survey to understand the characteristics of the market for a new product. It is a simple questionnaire collecting the characteristics of respondents in a sample drawn out of the population as well as their willingness to buy the new product (it is described in the questionnaire). Then, the data are analyzed to produce the tree in the figure here below. Each leaf of the tree reports the number of respondents therein. For each leaf the fraction of individuals willing to buy the new product is also reported. For instance, leaf 4 reports a fraction as large as 0.525 among the 200 respondents.</p> <p></p> <p>Using the data in the figure derive the proportion of individuals willing to buy the product among males (node 2) and among females (node 3) as well as the standard errors of those proportions.</p> Answer <p>The proportion in node 2 is: </p> \\[ \\begin{split} P_{M} &amp;= \\frac{200 \\times 0.525 + 250 \\times 0.48}{200+250} \\\\ &amp;= 0.50 \\\\ \\text{S.E.}_{M} &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{0.50 \\times (1-0.50)}{200 + 250}}\\\\ &amp;= 0.02357 \\\\ P_{F} &amp;= \\frac{300 \\times 0.333 + 250 \\times 0.52}{300+250} \\\\ &amp;= 0.418 \\\\ \\text{S.E.}_{F} &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{0.418 \\times (1-0.418)}{300 + 250}}\\\\ &amp;= 0.02103 \\\\ \\end{split} \\] <p>Establish whether the difference between the two proportions derived at the previous point is statistically significant.</p> Answer <p>To establish the statistical significance it is needed to derive the confidence interval for the two proportions at a certain level, in this case 0.95:</p> \\[ \\begin{split} P_{M}: &amp;(0.50 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.02357) \\\\ &amp;(0.4538, 0.5462) \\\\ P_{F}: &amp;(0.418 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.02103) \\\\ &amp;(0.3768, 0.4592) \\\\ \\end{split} \\] <p>In this case the two intervals are just marginally overlapping (the higher limit of \\(P_{F}\\) is contained in \\(P_{M}\\) interval), and this is at the border of statistical significance</p>"}, {"location": "student-life/drink/", "title": "Where to drink", "text": "<p>Still work in progress!</p>"}, {"location": "student-life/drink/#beer", "title": "Beer", "text": "<ul> <li>Crack: probably one of the best local craft breweries</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "student-life/drink/#spritz", "title": "Spritz", "text": "<ul> <li>Fly: one of the few bars left that offer spritz at 2\u20ac</li> <li>Caffe Carlotta: other than chips, they offer you pizza on a wooden cutting board (for free!) if you take a spritz</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "student-life/drink/#wine", "title": "Wine", "text": "<ul> <li>Corte Sconta: great wine choice, but you'll probably have to drink outside</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "student-life/drink/#cocktails", "title": "Cocktails", "text": "<ul> <li>BarCode: a wide choice of cocktails and shots for every taste</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "student-life/drink/#unique-places", "title": "Unique places", "text": "<ul> <li>Bar da Mario: ask Mario and her daughter for a \"Morandini\" or a \"Polifonico\" (secret recipes!), and dive fully into the goliardic spirit</li> <li>Naviglio: opened from April to October, from 16 till late, experience a riverside walk full of bars</li> <li>Caf\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re: enter a peculiar BDSM atmosphere... \ud83d\udc40</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "student-life/food/", "title": "Where to eat", "text": "<p>Our favourite places where to eat</p>"}, {"location": "student-life/food/#student-canteens", "title": "Student canteens", "text": "<p>All canteens affiliated with ESU offer two meal choices:</p> <ul> <li>full meal for 4.70\u20ac: main course, second course, bread, unlimited drinks, dessert</li> <li>half meal for 3.50\u20ac: one course, bread, unlimited drinks, dessert</li> </ul> <p>To eat here, one has to follow the instructions on the official ESU website.</p> <p>The best canteens are with no doubts Murialdo and Forcellini.
