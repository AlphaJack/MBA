# IELTS

A small list of resources and websites I have used to prepare for my [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/) test.

## General tips

Get a basic idea of what the test looks like, then take a full test as soon as possible to understand what sections need more focus. To get your score for the speaking and writing sections, see below for free communities. 

Then, be sure to understand the test and the particular types of challenges and issues of every section before taking the actual test. You should have a clear idea of the criteria examiners are going to use for the speaking and writing part.

Review and practice your English grammar and vocabulary daily before the test, as it is crucial to achieve good results.

Don't use too many resources and remember to repeat the things you learn across multiple days. The night before the exam go to bed early, otherwise you won't perform at your top during the test.

Regarding your equipment, use a soft pencil instead of pen to gain speed and allow for instant corrections with the rubber. Also take a sharpener you know works well with your pencil and a bottle of water with you. You may be asked to leave your watch in your bag, so practice without it.

## Speaking

Your test will be recordered by a portable device and the examiner will note some timestamps, so don't worry about it.

Time flies when you are in the room so if you have not practiced enough you won't be able to apply your strategies. The first questions will be used to identify you, then you will need to introduce yourself with 2-3 sentences per answer.

For the second part you can use the [PPF technique](https://8777ielts.com/2018/11/29/ppf-past-present-future-ielts-speaking/) or expand the bullet points you are given to speak for two minutes. Listening to your recorded voice helps, but if you join Discord servers you can schedule real tests with other test-takers.

For the third part you can show off your knowledge of grammar with subordinate sentences and complex periods. The important thing is that you

## Listening

Listening is the first part of the written exam, it will give you a confidence boost if you do it properly.

Before the recording starts, highlight key words in the question so you understand what your are going to hear. The four audio tracks are split according to the set of questions you are asked to answer (e.g. checkboxes 21 to 27), so don't spend time on irrelevant questions (e.g. answer gaps 27 to 32).

While you listen, try to take small relevant notes and exclude the answers you find incorrect.

When you are given time to check your answers, read and focus instead on the next set of questions, as you will have time to go back in the final 10 minutes.

Sometimes the answer may not be given explicitely, so you may have to recognize a synonym or even deduct the answer by other informations.

There is no penalty for wrong answers, be sure to not leave anything blank.

## Reading


Yes/No/Not given are considered by many the toughest question type  
Quickly (500wpm) read the first and last line of paragraphs, read each set of answers, go quickly (250wpm) back and try to find the keyword or a synonym of it, then read carefully (100wpm) the sentence to find the answer  
Transfer the answers on the answer sheet as there is no extra time  
Highlight when reading  

There is no penalty for wrong answers, be sure to not leave anything blank.

Remember to time each section properly, you have just three sections but you must also find some time to review and transcribe your answers.

## Writing

Do not waste time drafting your answer on the topic booklet, when you feel ready and have clear ideas on what you are going to write, just do it in pencil on the answer sheet. In this way you can easily correct yourself if you recognize a mistake. Remember to make a large use of subordinate sentences to boost your score, rather than relying on fancy words that don't suit with the argument.

For task 1 remember to not make suppositions on the cause of the data; you also don't need  a concluding paragraph.

For task 2 try to apply the [PEEL technique](https://www.studiosity.com/blog/how-to-structure-paragraphs-using-the-peel-method) to develop a consistent essay.

Remember to time each section properly, task 2 is worth twice as task 1, and you also need some time to review your answer for each one of them.
