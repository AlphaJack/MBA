    What is an IPO, and what role do investment banks play in this process?

    ??? answer
        An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is when a private company goes public by issuing shares of stock for sale to the general public for the first time. Investment banks play a crucial role in this process by acting as underwriters for the IPO. This means that they help the company determine how many shares to issue and at what price, and then they buy these shares from the company and sell them to investors. Investment banks also help prepare the necessary regulatory filings and marketing materials for the IPO.
