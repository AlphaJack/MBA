 <!-- EXAM -->
!!! question
    What problems emerged in the introduction of technological innovations during the first industrial revolution?

    ??? answer      
        Despite their role as enablers of progress, technological innovations of the first industrial revolution brought to light some problems:  
        
        - workers needed to adjust their habits and rhythms imposed by new technologies, such as transportation and factory innovations, clock with a fixed amount of hours job and swift between workers to let the machinery work.
        - advancements in the factory system made industries more profitable than agriculture, shifting investments from this sector to the other, and workforce from the countryside to the city. This further lead to overcrowded city districts with poor quality of life due to poor hygienic conditions, scarcity of food and heating fuel
        - the cheaper price of machineries was more appealing than paying high wages to workers; this lead to a substitution of part of the workforce with machineries in some industries 
        - as production of goods requires coordination across multiple actors in a vertical chain, in many cases a bottleneck can arise at a certain point. Technological innovations of an actor may shift the bottleneck to another one, if they don't incurr in any technological innvation or other production improvements

### National big businesses

 <!-- EXAM -->
!!! question
    What changes enabled big business to dominate their respective industries as early as the Second lndustrial Revalutian?
    
    ??? answer
        Citing Schumpeter and his view, innovations occur when there is a "disruptive change" in the market.  
        At that time there were changes in technologies, in markets and in organizations:
        
        - technological changes refers to the telegraph, telephone and steam engine for transport purposes
        - market changes refer to the opening to foreign trade and also investment in foreign markets
        - organizational changes refer to the introduction of chain production, ordering via mail and automatically packaging
        
        With the enlargement of markets, firms tried to introduce a way to make more profits, and they accomplished this by exploiting economies of scale, firstly in American and then also in Europe.  
        In America they build up Corporations, single entities obtained after a merger of more entites. This occurred because American banned cartels and favored monopolies.  
        In Europe on the other hand, there were cartels in Germany financed by large banks. 

        Large companies could:
        
        - exploit internal economies of scale by addressing mass praduction with capital-intensive technologies
        - gather mare financial resaurces from big banks (and later public capital markets)
        - benefit fram national subsidies in same industries 
        - become major producers in natural monopolies markets characterized by a large MES requirement and little competition
        - enable the collaboration af various stakeholders: warkers, managers, financers, politicians
        - collude with other large firms in various ways, for instance by creating lobbies or cartels where allawed

        The ways to enlarge firms at that time were: mergers, vertical integration and acquisitions.  
        In Germany there were more frequent backward integration due to lack of raw materials, while in the US there were more forward integrations due the closeness of markets. 
        
!!! question

 <!-- EXAM -->
??? question
    Why did the M-form do well in the United States and less well in Europe?
    
    ??? answer
        M-form management, characterized by a clear separation between ownership and management, self-financed corporate divisions and separate strategic planning in the head quarter thrived in the US but not in the old continent. 
        
        The main reason for that is the complex structure it requires, suited for large corporations typical of the US, where the national market was bigger and less fragmented than the European one.
        
        In Europe instead the H-form was more common, as it only required a holding company originated from M&A and a set of subsidiaries. Cartels were also common in Germany, while they were forbidden in the US.
        
        SME in the continent also keep covering an important role, as they were often family businesses targeting niche markets. For these, a hierarchical bureaucratic shape like the U-form was better suited.
        
        In the US companies were more decentralized and the separation between ownership and management was stronger than in Europe. Also, managers moved more among firms than in Europe, and this was an effect of the better institution of American business schools.

        - More unions in Europe, higher wages in America
        - More opportunities in America than in Europe 

!!! question
    Why did families continue to play an important role inside big businesses in Great Britain?

    ??? answer
        Although, many British companies remained largely "personal". Families sought to retain their role in business. Different from M form. The separation of ownership and control had not progressed far enough to displace founding or family directors from company boards many families were present as an important minority. They remain because they played a crucial role in financing enterprises.
        
        A consequence of this is that the second generation of business owners were: sons of businessmen, sons of farmers, children of public officials and children of blue-collar employees.

        - Availability of relatively cheap raw materials and oil in heavy industries
        - External environment: the relationship with the world economy was favored by the worldwide movement toward free trade aided Japanese firms -> Japan signed General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT – 1947) but it was able to use the GATT agreements in order to restrict foreign investments in its companies and the import of foreign goods in order to protect national products
        - Government relation with businesses: the Japanese government tried to guide the development, not through public production but by directing the private development of firms through incentives (role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry)

??? question
    What were the strategic factors in Japan's growth in the 1950s and 1960s?
    
    ??? answer
        Despite its defeat in WWII, the shortage of food, fuel, jobs and the high inflation rate, Japan saw a huge growth between the 1950s and the 1960s, often referred as "miracle”. This was mostly because of:
        
        - availability of raw materials for oil and heavy industries
        - subscription of the GATT agreement for free trade with other countries
        - protectionism to limit certain foreign investments in Japanese companies and imports of foreign goods 
        - collaboration between the goverment and private firms, aimed at developing industries through private incentives
        - "Big Push" strategy, i.e. lot of investments in supply without any guarantees on the demand side
        - business reorganization from zaibatsu to keiretss 
        - development of automotive, television and air conditioner sectors which helped upstream suppliers, internal consumerism and population growth

!!! question
    How did the evolution from _Zaibatsu_ to kereitsu happened? What is the role of the subcontractors in this new organization?
    
    ??? answer
        Differences with _Zaibatsu_:
        
        - Lacked any central headquarters or holding company owning stock in subsidiary companies (no more the joint-stock companies)
        - Grouped, called _Keiretsu_, were more informal meetings of the heads of the various companies
        - _Keiretsu_ are networks of businesses bound by informal agreement.
        
        The reason for the aggregation of Japanese firms comes from historical reason (tradition of Confucianism).    
        All large enterprises use subcontractors and many of them were specialized and provide high-quality products.  
        By using subcontractors, Toyota and other companies were able to expand production greatly at little cost. The use of subcontractors allowed them to keep their capital investments and labor costs lower than they would otherwise have been.

!!! question
    What have been the main political mistakes of the Chinese government?
    
    ??? answer
        - Agricultural efforts were hurt by bad weather and floods in the 1950s
        - The great leap forward: aimed at catching up with Great Britain in steel production, the building of backyard furnaces to make steelàpoor quality steel and unsustainable strategy, and fewer workers in agricultureà20-30 million died
        - Farmers were obliged to move for other jobs
        - Public investments were mainly in industries, but the consumption of goods was not favored
        - Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-68): farmers were obliged to move toward other jobs, urban workers were obliged to move toward agricultural activity. Only in the 1970s the Cultural Revolution winds down, especially with Mao's death in 1976.
    
!!! question
    What were the main consequences of the socialization process?
    
    ??? answer
        - Land reform and collectivization, wealthy peasants lost much of their land
        - From small firms in agriculture to large firms in agriculture
        - Large firms could benefit from economies of scale (with capital, larger firms are more productive; with more workers, small firms are more productive)àin China there were more people than capitalàso the government failed with this strategy following the soviet experience
        - The state built all the railroads and a majority of steamships in China's home waters
        - Industry same trend -> Soviet Union's influence -> five-years based plans
        - Also the railroads, steamships and trading companies were nationalized
    
!!! question
    Describe the shift from state economy to market economy in China
    
	??? answer
		After the death of Mao, shift to market economy. Communist's party allowed liberalization of the market (not completely) and the building of factories in China.
		
        - Centralized economy and liberalization of market
            This change was an important step to “household responsibility system” -> farm families could sell surplus agricultural production in open markets, as long as they retained a certain amount of their produce for the state.
            Strengthening of TVEs in light industry
        - Throughout the 1980s the “iron rice bowl” gradually eroded, and in 1991 the government abolished guaranteed employment altogether.
        - It was a gradual privatization not like the Soviet one (shock privatization)
        - The government permitted entrepreneurs to set up private businesses, some of which grew rapidly in size and importance.
        
        All trends in China were toward the privatization of business, although all banks remained state-owned (the influence of the government remained substantial).
